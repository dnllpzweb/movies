1
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:43,492
Surprise!

2
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,704
Happy birthday, Daddy!

3
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,373
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

4
00:04:49,582 --> 00:04:51,542
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

5
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:55,880
<i>Happy birthday, dear Daddy
Happy birthday to you!</i>

6
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:57,715
Make a wish!

7
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,050
I wish...
I'm not going to tell you.

8
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,219
Come on, blow them out!

9
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:08,851
Give me some sugar, girl.

10
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:12,313
One more candle and the
smoke alarm would've gone off.

11
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:18,194
The big 5-0.

12
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,574
You know, your beard's getting gray.
Kind of makes you look old.

13
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:25,618
It's all right. I still love you.

14
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,412
Bye, Pa.

15
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:18,856
- Good morning!
- Hi, Mrs. Murtaugh.

16
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,067
- Where's Rianne?
- She's upstairs.

17
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,237
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

18
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:27,489
- That's my bacon!
- It's mine now.

19
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:29,867
Don't you close doors around here?

20
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,744
Baby, what's this on my tie?

21
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,872
That is an ugly spot.

22
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,333
Thanks. Sharp as a tack.

23
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,960
I'm thinking of going on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

24
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:43,047
Just don't take any
questions about cooking.

25
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,261
Don't step in the egg!

26
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:53,974
What am I thinking? I should have
checked the floor for egg!

27
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:59,063
Do you know a man named Michael Hunsaker?

28
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:01,482
Michael Hunsaker?

29
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,276
Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!

30
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,693
- What did he want?
- Your office called.

31
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:09,073
He's tried to reach you for three days.

32
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,116
I haven't talked to him in...

33
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,244
...twelve years!

34
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,413
Wait a minute.

35
00:08:16,622 --> 00:08:18,624
That would make me...

36
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,001
...fifty!

37
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:23,128
That means that you're...

38
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,756
We're not gonna discuss it.

39
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,633
Forget the eggs.

40
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,095
- Roger?
- Yeah, baby?

41
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,639
How come I never heard
of Michael Hunsaker?

42
00:08:33,931 --> 00:08:35,599
Just never talked about him.

43
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:37,309
Vietnam buddy?

44
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:39,645
Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.

45
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,271
- Daddy?
- Yeah, baby?

46
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,315
Nick and the kids left without me.

47
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:47,027
He left without you? Come on,
I never get enough of my baby.

48
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:50,948
This is my New Year's Eve dress.
Do you like it? Isn't it cool?

49
00:08:51,156 --> 00:08:52,574
It's beautiful.

50
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:56,286
Have a good birthday.

51
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,547
Goddamn heartbreaker!

52
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:21,687
Happy birthday, Rog!

53
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,649
Hey, happy birthday, Rog.

54
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,862
- Lay off me.
- You got a spot on your tie.

55
00:09:30,154 --> 00:09:31,155
What do we got here?

56
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,698
We got a hooker.

57
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,577
No, it's Dixie. Would you please
tell these bozos to lay off?

58
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,120
You bozos, lay off.

59
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:41,081
Had a jumper here last night.
She saw it happen.

60
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:43,208
Get her statement, send her home.

61
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,170
Thanks. I'm beat.
You know how it is.

62
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,630
All dressed up, no one to blow.

63
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,384
You're hilarious!
I can't believe you damn cops!

64
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,345
The jumper's name is Amanda Hunsaker.

65
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:57,723
Age 22.

66
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,019
Prostitute. One arrest,
no convictions. Born in Tennessee.

67
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,896
- Parents...
- What was the name?

68
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:06,815
The parents.

69
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,401
Michael and Claire.

70
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:11,904
You know them?

71
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:15,991
Right. Find out who bought it,
who's paying the bills.

72
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,827
- That will take some looking into.
- So look!

73
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,330
Yeah.

74
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,231
Hello, honey.

75
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,943
Give me the number for Michael Hunsaker.

76
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,904
<i>The man we talked about?
Your Vietnam buddy?</i>

77
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:57,282
- You just mentioned him this morning.
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

78
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,785
His daughter just dove out a window.

79
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,916
I got it.

80
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:24,226
Hey.

81
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,271
Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?

82
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:33,193
- Yeah, that's good.
- You better fucking believe it.

83
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,487
Let's do it. How much?

84
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:37,447
How much for how much?

85
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,408
For all of it.

86
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,816
- You want it all? He wants it all.
- He wants it all. Beautiful!

87
00:11:42,953 --> 00:11:45,831
- All right!
- And nice tree to put it under.

88
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,125
- You want a tree?
- Yeah!

89
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,835
I'll tell you what.

90
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,005
I'll give you the best tree
on the lot for nothing.

91
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:55,716
But the shit's gonna cost you...

92
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,718
...a hundred.

93
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:58,886
That much?

94
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:00,929
That's a fair price.

95
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,098
Yeah. Hell...

96
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,516
...you only live once.

97
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:06,727
Get this together here.

98
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,813
20, 40...

99
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:11,273
...60, 70...

100
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,651
- What the fuck?
- Hey, man!

101
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:15,819
Hey!

102
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,321
Shut up, I'm losing count.

103
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,240
93, 94, 95, 96...

104
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,992
Forget it, dumbshit!

105
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:24,328
One hundred thousand!

106
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:27,039
One hundred thousand dollars!

107
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,042
A hundred thousand?

108
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,796
I can't afford that. Not on my salary.
But look, I got a better idea.

109
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:39,551
Let me say I take the whole stash
off your hands for free...

110
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:43,764
...and you assholes go to jail.
What do you say?

111
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:49,770
I could read you your rights, but you
already know what your rights are.

112
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,025
This badge ain't real.

113
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,526
You ain't real.

114
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,196
You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.

115
00:13:01,657 --> 00:13:02,658
I'm crazy?

116
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,786
You think I am crazy?

117
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,579
I'll show you...

118
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,191
That's a real badge, I'm a real cop
and this is a real gun.

119
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:16,546
Okay, pal.

120
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,507
Noses in the dirt, assholes!

121
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:32,104
Where's your buddy?

122
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:37,192
What do you got?

123
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,737
Three down and one loose.
He's got a red shirt.

124
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,406
Okay, let's go.

125
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,327
Freeze! Give me the gun! Up, up!

126
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,955
How's it feel, sucker?

127
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,540
Shoot him!

128
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,749
Drop it!

129
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,626
Shoot him! Shoot him!

130
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,421
- Shut the fuck up!
- Shoot this prick!

131
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,133
Shoot him! Somebody
shoot this prick!

132
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,843
Shoot me.

133
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,429
Shut up! Put them down!

134
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:08,849
- I warn you! I'm going to shoot you!
- Shoot him!

135
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,892
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

136
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:13,270
Shoot me! Shoot him!

137
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,154
Get him out of there.

138
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,157
It ain't worth it.

139
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:35,417
Hey, wait up already!

140
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:05,567
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

141
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,639
I miss you...

142
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,976
...Victoria Lynn.

143
00:17:53,949 --> 00:17:55,951
That's silly, isn't it?

144
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:03,500
I'll see you later.

145
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:07,295
I'll see you much later.

146
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,096
Once more with feeling on three.

147
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:21,101
Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,
or go on the street.

148
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,358
<i>Silent night</i>

149
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,028
Are you telling me
Riggs is playing a game?

150
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:35,699
Sure. He wants the cash.
But he'll come around.

151
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,285
That's a very dangerous attitude to take.

152
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:43,206
Remember, his wife of 11 years
was just killed in a car accident.

153
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:47,377
- He pulls his gun when he shouldn't.
- I know all about him.

154
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,837
He's a tough bastard.

155
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,299
He's on the edge. I'm telling you,
he may be psychotic.

156
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,467
That's a bunch of psych bullshit.

157
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,554
You're making a mistake
by keeping him in the field.

158
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,556
The man is suicidal.

159
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,600
You're sure of that diagnosis?
You have no doubts?

160
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,561
There are no absolutes in life.

161
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,397
End of discussion.
We're going to wait.

162
00:19:07,731 --> 00:19:10,358
If he offs himself,
then we'll know I was wrong.

163
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,903
You're making
a mistake, because if you're wrong...

164
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:22,746
Asshole!

165
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,915
Roger, you're way behind the times.

166
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:30,086
The guys in the 80s aren't tough.
They're sensitive people.

167
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:33,465
They show emotions around women,
shit like that.

168
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,760
I think I'm an 80s man.

169
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,511
How do you figure?

170
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:40,180
Last night...

171
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,599
...I cried in bed. How's that?

172
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,312
Were you with a woman?

173
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:51,232
I was alone. Why do you think
I was crying? Merry Christmas.

174
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:53,610
Sounds like an 80s man to me.

175
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,780
- News on the Hunsaker case.
- That was quick.

176
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:00,450
So was the autopsy.
They're not calling it a suicide.

177
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:04,996
Surprise. The coroner
found evidence she used barbiturates.

178
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,207
Brilliant detective work.

179
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:09,125
There were pills all over.

180
00:20:09,417 --> 00:20:11,753
Right. That's not the surprise.

181
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,547
The surprise is the pills were doctored.

182
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:17,634
The capsules were loaded
with drain cleaner.

183
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,052
She'd have died anyway.

184
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,261
This case stinks.

185
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:24,265
You know,
you looked younger with the beard.

186
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:26,267
Thanks, captain.

187
00:20:28,103 --> 00:20:29,187
You shaved the beard.

188
00:20:29,646 --> 00:20:30,897
Some detective.

189
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,732
Two more things.

190
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,111
The condition of the sheets indicates...

191
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:39,447
...someone else was
in bed with Amanda. That's "A."

192
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,657
What's "B"?

193
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:44,160
"B" is, you're breaking in
a new partner on this.

194
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,495
Partner again?

195
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:49,207
Some cat on loan from Dope.
Real burnout, on the edge.

196
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,625
Perfect.

197
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:54,337
Gun!

198
00:21:01,136 --> 00:21:02,846
Rog, meet your new partner.

199
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,310
I'm too old for this shit.

200
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:16,025
There are those who say you're a good cop.

201
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,694
I try.

202
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:22,365
I heard about the little
stunt yesterday. Pretty heroic.

203
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:26,327
I pulled your file.

204
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:30,373
Said you worked in the Phoenix
project in Vietnam. That right?

205
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:33,543
Assassination stuff.
It's over, you know.

206
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,378
What is?

207
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,046
The war.

208
00:21:37,338 --> 00:21:38,882
Yes, I know.

209
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,884
Just thought I'd remind you.

210
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:45,388
That's some serious shit you carry.

211
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,516
Be my guest.

212
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,066
9mm Beretta. Takes 15
in the mag, one up the pipe...

213
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,029
...wide ejection port, no feed jams.

214
00:22:01,404 --> 00:22:02,489
What have you got?

215
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:03,865
Four-inch Smith.

216
00:22:05,408 --> 00:22:06,493
Six-shooter?

217
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,677
A lot of old-timers carry those.

218
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:16,669
File also said you're heavy
into martial arts.

219
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,256
Tai chi and all that killer stuff.

220
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:23,927
I suppose we have to register you
as a lethal weapon.

221
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:28,598
Let's just cut the shit.
We both know why I was transferred.

222
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:33,186
Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,
so nobody wants to work with me.

223
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:35,897
Some think I'm faking
to draw psycho pension...

224
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:40,109
...so nobody wants to work with me.
Basically, I'm fucked.

225
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:41,361
Guess what?

226
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:44,364
- I don't want to work with you.
- Then don't.

227
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:48,701
Ain't got no choice.
Looks like we both got fucked.

228
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,911
Terrific.

229
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:55,792
God hates me, is what it is.

230
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,128
Hate him back. It works for me.

231
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,732
- Good afternoon, Mr. Mendez.
- How you doing?

232
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:21,234
Did you pat him down?

233
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:24,153
- We went through this already.
- Go through it again.

234
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:25,655
Who are you?

235
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:28,992
That's hardly important,
but you may call me Mr. Joshua.

236
00:23:29,242 --> 00:23:30,285
Let's go.

237
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,829
Great, swell. Mr. Joshua, huh?

238
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:39,502
General, Mr. Mendez is here.

239
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:47,010
You call this music? I can get
a better band for half the price.

240
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:51,014
I don't want to hear any of this shit.
Let's get it right.

241
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,351
Mr. Mendez, how are you?

242
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,853
I'm fine.

243
00:23:57,562 --> 00:24:00,023
Where did you get him?
Psychos "R" Us?

244
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,608
I don't think you're funny.

245
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:04,569
I don't think this whole
goddamn setup is funny.

246
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:07,530
You're using mercenaries.
Tell me I'm wrong!

247
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,115
You're not wrong.

248
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,826
And you expect me to trust these bozos?

249
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,370
My people are loyal to me.

250
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,205
Bullshit.

251
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,707
Do you smoke?

252
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,959
What does that have to do with it?

253
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:21,127
Do you smoke?!

254
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:23,004
Yeah.

255
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:24,631
Give me your lighter.

256
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:26,883
- My lighter?
- Your lighter!

257
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:28,635
Okay. Right here.

258
00:24:29,344 --> 00:24:30,386
Here. Take it.

259
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,389
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

260
00:24:33,723 --> 00:24:34,974
Shut your mouth!

261
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:36,601
Shut up!

262
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:38,394
And don't move.

263
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,109
Mr. Joshua, your left arm, please.

264
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:58,081
Hey, you guys are fucking gone.
You know what I am saying?

265
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,416
Jesus Christ, man!

266
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:04,754
You guys are fucking
crazy, man. Come on!

267
00:25:09,509 --> 00:25:11,636
Have Endo look at that, Mr. Joshua.

268
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:14,931
Yes, sir.

269
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:18,601
You wish to do business with us, yes?

270
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,019
Jesus Christ!

271
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:22,647
You wish to make a purchase, yes?

272
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,150
Yes, yes! Jesus Christ, yes.

273
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,948
You guys are out there like
fucking Pluto, man. You're gone!

274
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:36,411
The heroin will be here Friday night.
We'll make delivery at that time.

275
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,788
Have the money ready, and no tricks.

276
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:42,417
If you try anything,
you'll have to talk to Mr. Joshua.

277
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,962
Right. Joshua. I got you.

278
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:48,464
Merry Christmas.

279
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,634
Yeah, right. You too, pal.

280
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,647
Mike...

281
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:10,611
...the autopsy report showed
that Amanda was poisoned.

282
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,906
Even if she hadn't jumped,
she'd still be dead.

283
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,327
- She was murdered.
- Murdered?

284
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,167
Jesus!

285
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,507
I can't take this.
I just can't take this.

286
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:33,843
Mike...

287
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:37,680
Why did you try to get in touch with me?

288
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,519
I heard that you were...

289
00:26:44,854 --> 00:26:47,690
Somebody told me you were
working out here.

290
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,028
I thought you could get her out.

291
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,988
Get her out of what?

292
00:26:56,866 --> 00:27:01,537
Get her out of the stuff she was into.
She was making...

293
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,539
...videotapes.

294
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,709
Pornographic...

295
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,004
...videotapes.

296
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:14,383
I thought maybe you could just
get her out. Help her.

297
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:29,565
Easy, Mike.

298
00:27:36,531 --> 00:27:38,282
You owe me, Roger.

299
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,409
Remember?

300
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:45,373
Yeah.

301
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,085
I remember.

302
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:53,256
I want you to find whoever's
responsible for this...

303
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,759
...however many of them there are.

304
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:03,307
I know you can do it.
Just find them and kill them.

305
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:05,059
I'm a police officer.

306
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:08,271
I don't give a shit
that you're a police officer!

307
00:28:08,688 --> 00:28:10,731
Kill them! Just kill them!

308
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:13,442
Wait. Wait, Rog.

309
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:16,112
Come on. You find them
and you kill them.

310
00:28:16,404 --> 00:28:19,448
You can do that. You owe me.

311
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:24,871
I owe you.

312
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:28,624
Gotta go, man.

313
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,926
What did he mean
when he said you owed him?

314
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,470
We served together in 1965.

315
00:28:41,888 --> 00:28:45,600
Ia Drang Valley. Saved my life.
Took a bayonet in the lungs.

316
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:48,477
- That was nice of him.
- I thought so.

317
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,856
- Want me to drive?
- You're supposed to be suicidal.

318
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,859
Anybody who drives
in this town is suicidal.

319
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:59,155
<i>All units, possible jumper
at Santa Monica and Orlando.</i>

320
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,908
<i>7-A-21, handle code two.</i>

321
00:29:03,367 --> 00:29:06,662
<i>- All units, come in, please.</i>
- Gotcha!

322
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:09,498
- What's the number of the car?
- 3-William-56.

323
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:13,753
3-William-56 en route.
I love this job! It's so exciting!

324
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:16,672
<i>Copy.
Police psychologist on the way.</i>

325
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:20,676
Hey, boss, can we put the sirens on?

326
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,109
Guys, I'm glad you're here.

327
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,779
- Where's the psychologist?
- Stuck in traffic.

328
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,113
Who's this guy?

329
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,534
Name's McCleary. He was at an
office party and just went outside.

330
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:48,704
- You think he'll go?
- Seems serious enough. Who knows?

331
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,874
- I can handle this.
- Are you qualified?

332
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,210
- I've done it before.
- You're elected.

333
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:58,172
- No guns, just bring him down.
- Roger.

334
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,049
10-4.

335
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:18,901
- Who are you?
- Riggs, homicide.

336
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:20,987
He's over there on the end.

337
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,749
Merry Christmas.

338
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,752
Leave me alone!

339
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,212
What are you doing?

340
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,006
None of your damn business!

341
00:30:40,756 --> 00:30:42,383
Fair enough.

342
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:45,720
I'm just going to come out there, okay?

343
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:48,472
Don't!
You touch me, I'm gonna jump!

344
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,184
Take it easy, for chrissake!

345
00:30:52,476 --> 00:30:54,770
I don't like this any better than you do.

346
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,356
I can't stand heights.

347
00:30:57,606 --> 00:30:58,858
This makes me dizzy.

348
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,527
Just give me a chance to talk to you.

349
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,407
I'm gonna stand on the ledge with you.

350
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:09,201
Don't go. Not out on the ledge.

351
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:13,497
You're not the first guy
to think of this, you know.

352
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:16,625
A lot of people got problems
during this season.

353
00:31:17,376 --> 00:31:20,129
- You know shit!
- No, you're wrong, pal.

354
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,798
You know nothing! Don't touch me!

355
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:24,717
I didn't do anything wrong!

356
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,928
I know that. It's not like
you're murdering anyone.

357
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:30,056
- That's right!
- That's right.

358
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:33,059
The only one I hurt is me! Me!

359
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,895
That's right. I know
you're hurting. I get it.

360
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:38,647
Don't come near me!

361
00:31:38,981 --> 00:31:41,317
Give me a break.
My boss is watching me.

362
00:31:41,609 --> 00:31:44,320
I got to make it look
like I'm trying to save you.

363
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,155
Come on.

364
00:31:47,782 --> 00:31:51,160
I'm just gonna stand here
and talk to you. That's all.

365
00:31:51,827 --> 00:31:54,330
You won't try nothing?

366
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,832
I'm square with you.
I won't try a thing.

367
00:31:57,291 --> 00:32:01,170
You think I want to fall off?
I promise, I'll just talk to you.

368
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:03,839
All right.

369
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,843
Here, you want a cigarette?
Come on, let's smoke, okay?

370
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,095
Yeah.

371
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,346
Go on, take it.

372
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,973
Take our time and both die of cancer.

373
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:22,858
Here.

374
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,903
Hate you to leave without me.

375
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:28,030
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

376
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:30,574
See this key?

377
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,326
Bye-bye!

378
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:33,953
You're crazy!

379
00:32:34,203 --> 00:32:38,165
You can jump, but you'd take me
with you, making you a murderer.

380
00:32:38,374 --> 00:32:40,584
- You bastard!
- You'd be killing a cop.

381
00:32:40,835 --> 00:32:42,378
Yeah, a psycho nut cop!

382
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,713
I'm still a cop.
You coming in?

383
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,633
- I'm jumping!
- Do you really wanna jump?

384
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:51,220
Do you wanna?
That's fine with me. Come on!

385
00:32:51,554 --> 00:32:53,180
Let's do it, asshole.

386
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,015
I want to do it.

387
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,196
Shit!

388
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,412
Help!

389
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:18,247
You want to go up again?

390
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,207
Come on, it was great.

391
00:33:22,543 --> 00:33:24,879
Help me! Help me loose!

392
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:27,047
He's trying to kill me!

393
00:33:27,423 --> 00:33:30,759
Did you see that?
He's out of his mind! He's crazy!

394
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:33,220
I want my cuffs back.

395
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:36,557
- Don't you touch me!
- What the fuck did you just do?

396
00:33:36,891 --> 00:33:40,060
I controlled the jump!
You wanted him down? He's down!

397
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:41,437
Come here!

398
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,439
Come here with me!

399
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,452
Get in here!

400
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,251
Okay, no bullshit!
You want to kill yourself?

401
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,670
Shut up! Yes or no?
You want to die?

402
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:09,131
I got the job done!

403
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,300
Just answer the question!

404
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,427
What do you want to hear, man?

405
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,263
That sometimes I think about
eating a bullet?

406
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:18,807
Well, I do!

407
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:22,269
I got a special one for the occasion,
with a hollow point.

408
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:25,981
Make sure it blows
the back of my goddamn head out!

409
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,485
Every day I wake up and think
of a reason not to do it.

410
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:31,946
Every single day.

411
00:34:32,655 --> 00:34:35,950
And you know why I don't?
This is gonna make you laugh.

412
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,286
The job. Doing the job.
That's the reason.

413
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:43,207
- You want to die!
- I don't. I'm not afraid of it.

414
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:47,503
Here, take my gun. Don't nibble
on the barrel, pull the trigger.

415
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:50,172
Be my guest!
Go ahead, if you're serious!

416
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,258
You shouldn't tempt me.

417
00:34:53,092 --> 00:34:57,012
In your mouth. Bullet may go
through your ear and not kill you.

418
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,265
Under the chin's just as good!

419
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:14,405
Ow!

420
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,326
You're not trying
to draw a psycho pension.

421
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:23,038
You really are crazy.

422
00:35:27,459 --> 00:35:31,630
I'm hungry. I'm gonna go
and get something to eat.

423
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:47,563
<i>I don't know. There's
something eating away at this guy.</i>

424
00:35:47,855 --> 00:35:52,192
<i>I think he's on the edge.
I think Riggs has a death wish.</i>

425
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:56,363
Terrific. So you're
saying I should worry?

426
00:35:57,698 --> 00:35:59,366
I think you should worry.

427
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,910
<i>When he goes,
you don't want to be near him.</i>

428
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:04,997
Thank you, doctor.
You've been very helpful.

429
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:06,832
You're welcome.

430
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:14,089
I'm too old for this shit.

431
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,052
You hungry?

432
00:36:18,344 --> 00:36:20,054
No! I'm not hungry.

433
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:23,057
- Want me to drive?
- No! I'll drive!

434
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,433
Get in that side!

435
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,018
You drive.

436
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:37,696
You get a bad personal call?
Did the stock market crash?

437
00:36:38,322 --> 00:36:40,616
Don't worry. Here, have a French fry.

438
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:51,251
Fifty years old. What a birthday.
Fifty years old!

439
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:56,298
Been on the force 20 years, not
a scratch on me. Got a wife, kids...

440
00:36:56,757 --> 00:37:01,637
...house, boat. I can kiss it all
goodbye because of your death wish.

441
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:02,888
My life is over.

442
00:37:03,097 --> 00:37:04,765
Would you just shut up here!

443
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,935
Why are you talking to me anyway?
I'm a dead man!

444
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:13,357
I was driving before you were
an itch in your daddy's pants.

445
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,655
- I didn't know that.
- Know what?

446
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,990
That it was your birthday today.

447
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,785
It was yesterday.

448
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:28,163
Well, happy birthday for yesterday.

449
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,460
Sincerely. Happy birthday, man.

450
00:37:33,669 --> 00:37:34,795
Thanks.

451
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:41,301
Maybe we'll stay alive long enough
for me to buy you a present.

452
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,305
Don't thank me now.

453
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:49,643
It's the least I can do after
all the kindness you've shown me.

454
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,867
Are you gonna tell me where we're going?

455
00:38:05,701 --> 00:38:07,035
Are we together on this?

456
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:12,541
Beverly Hills. We got an address
on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.

457
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:15,210
Remember, he's not a suspect yet.

458
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:18,005
So we question him, not damage him.

459
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,716
I won't hurt. You do all the talking.

460
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,426
Let me do all the talking.

461
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:24,636
Experience counts here.

462
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,350
- You're not gonna smoke here.
- Well, I am.

463
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,687
What? Does this bother you?

464
00:38:33,896 --> 00:38:34,938
It bothers me.

465
00:38:35,189 --> 00:38:36,732
- Does it?
- Yeah.

466
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,027
I'll open a window.

467
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:45,324
That's not the point.
I have to take care of myself.

468
00:38:46,283 --> 00:38:48,535
4241 coming up.

469
00:38:48,744 --> 00:38:50,162
Bingo.

470
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,375
- Do we have a warrant?
- We don't need one.

471
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,878
Didn't take them long, huh?

472
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,760
Hey, guys, go on in!
Make yourselves at home!

473
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,386
Merry Christmas!

474
00:39:06,637 --> 00:39:08,639
- Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas!

475
00:39:08,889 --> 00:39:11,266
Don't need a warrant with an invitation.

476
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:16,438
I saw this place on
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless."

477
00:39:26,323 --> 00:39:27,783
Get the door.

478
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:42,798
- Nice and easy.
- Nice and easy.

479
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:47,803
- Looks like the Garden of Eden.
- Look at this!

480
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,597
Paradise.

481
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,561
Isn't that sweet?

482
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:58,146
I'm thinking probable cause.

483
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:12,327
Get the girls!

484
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,038
Okay, asshole!

485
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,374
Move! Come on! Get out!

486
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,418
Fast! Move!

487
00:40:20,711 --> 00:40:23,463
Get your hands on that tree
and face each other!

488
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,340
Hands in front of you!

489
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:28,677
- My leg...
- Don't move. I'll break your arm.

490
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:30,929
Got them!

491
00:40:34,016 --> 00:40:35,559
Show me your hands!

492
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,394
Right now!

493
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,855
Put your hands out there!

494
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,069
See how easy that was?

495
00:40:46,361 --> 00:40:49,865
Boom! Still alive.
Now we question him. You know why?

496
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:53,452
Because I didn't shoot him
or jump off a building with him.

497
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:55,120
The building guy lived.

498
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,997
The point being, no killing.

499
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,416
- No killing, right.
- Right.

500
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,668
Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.

501
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,588
Read him his rights.
I'll stand here being happy.

502
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,216
He's got a gun!

503
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,425
Oops.

504
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,638
You ever met anybody you didn't kill?

505
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:00,143
Well, I haven't killed you yet.

506
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:04,147
Don't do me no favors.

507
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:06,066
Don't you worry.

508
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:21,748
The coroner gave the body a ride downtown.

509
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,836
I guess we can get out of here.

510
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,343
I'm sorry about that shit
I said out there.

511
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:38,014
You saved my life. Thank you.

512
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:45,814
I bet that hurt to say.

513
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:49,609
You'll never know.

514
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:53,155
Let's get a bite to eat.

515
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:54,740
Get my shoes on.

516
00:43:05,709 --> 00:43:08,503
- Mom, Rog is coming.
- Okay, Carrie.

517
00:43:17,596 --> 00:43:21,641
Here's my welcoming committee!
Where's my daughter? Which one...?

518
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:25,228
- Come on, Daddy.
- This one's my daughter!

519
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,398
Home, both of you. Dinnertime.

520
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:30,400
How are you doing?

521
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,277
I am doing all right.

522
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,279
Is that a crook?

523
00:43:34,738 --> 00:43:37,282
No, this is my new partner, Martin.

524
00:43:39,201 --> 00:43:40,869
- Carrie.
- Carrie?

525
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:43,413
I'm glad you're home at a sensible hour.

526
00:43:43,705 --> 00:43:46,416
Well, I try to be a sensible dad.

527
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,418
Come on in, Martin.

528
00:43:49,252 --> 00:43:51,254
Yeah, close the door.

529
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:55,801
Hello, Nick. Get your legs
off the arm of the couch.

530
00:43:57,552 --> 00:44:01,473
How you doing? Is Mommy
in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.

531
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:09,648
Hello, baby!
I want you to meet...

532
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,734
I'd like you to meet Daddy's new partner.

533
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:14,569
- Martin Riggs.
- How are you?

534
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,781
- This is my wife, Trish.
- Pleased to meet you.

535
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:20,200
Martin's going to join us for dinner.

536
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:23,119
- Roast okay with you?
- What's for dinner?

537
00:44:23,787 --> 00:44:26,122
We'll see what's for dinner.

538
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:29,793
This is a brown, sticky...

539
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,670
It's roast.

540
00:44:31,962 --> 00:44:34,381
How about a brown, roast-like substance?

541
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,467
- Roger, you're being an asshole.
- I try not to be.

542
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,594
- Want a drink?
- What do you got?

543
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:41,847
We have Canadian Mist...

544
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:46,268
- You like Canadian Mist?
- Honey, it's in the back.

545
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:51,815
How come we didn't have fish?
I thought we had fish tonight.

546
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:53,733
Don't worry about the fish.

547
00:44:53,984 --> 00:44:55,986
Getting defensive...
Ever go fishing?

548
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:59,239
Not since I was a kid.
I used to go spear fishing.

549
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,534
All I caught was a cold.

550
00:45:04,995 --> 00:45:06,621
I got that boat out there.

551
00:45:06,955 --> 00:45:08,957
Rianne, get the dessert.

552
00:45:09,332 --> 00:45:12,544
Rianne! Your mother said
get the dessert.

553
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:15,130
- Get the dessert. Get to it!
- Shut up.

554
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:20,677
Catalina Island. Nothing
exciting, but I catch my allotment.

555
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:25,432
You can catch a few things out there.
I caught my wife out there.

556
00:45:26,975 --> 00:45:28,643
Nice fishing out there.

557
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:30,353
Mr. Riggs, care for a tart?

558
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:32,564
Thank you, yes. Call me Martin.

559
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:33,815
Martin.

560
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,067
Mr. Riggs.

561
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,694
Sit down.

562
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:41,656
Rianne, it's not the first time
we've had company.

563
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,207
<i>My name is Carrie, I'm no fairy
My sister's cherry</i>

564
00:45:51,541 --> 00:45:53,877
<i>She's in love with a guy named Martin...</i>

565
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,254
Nicholas!

566
00:45:56,463 --> 00:45:59,049
Come on. It was really good!

567
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:01,718
Yeah, Dad! Why don't you try it?

568
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,261
It was good.

569
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:07,307
Yeah, there you go.

570
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:10,018
<i>I'm gonna find a partner My name is Roger</i>

571
00:46:10,393 --> 00:46:13,980
<i>And I need to be modger
And a secret hodger</i>

572
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:16,191
You need some help.

573
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:17,901
I am awful!

574
00:46:32,082 --> 00:46:35,794
Hey, sarge! Thanks for
taking out the garbage.

575
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:39,255
But, honey, I'm entertaining our guest.

576
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:44,260
What do you think?

577
00:46:44,970 --> 00:46:47,722
It's nice. You know
anything about boats?

578
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:50,642
- I know what they cost.
- Can you sail this?

579
00:46:51,226 --> 00:46:53,895
What's wrong with you?
It's not a sailboat.

580
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:55,939
That's what I thought.

581
00:46:56,272 --> 00:47:01,111
There's no trick. That's the front,
that's the back, water all around.

582
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:04,072
Why you gotta make things so complicated?

583
00:47:05,198 --> 00:47:06,199
Here.

584
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:07,951
Thanks.

585
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:11,913
I don't. Things get complicated
all by themselves.

586
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,582
You mean Amanda Hunsaker's murder, huh?

587
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,835
Did I mention that? I didn't.

588
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,963
Didn't have to.
I can read your mind.

589
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:23,967
What's the matter with you?

590
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,934
- Why is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

591
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:29,305
You got one dead girl and one dead guy.

592
00:47:29,556 --> 00:47:33,977
The guy kills the girl. We kill him
because he wants us to be dead guys.

593
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:36,104
That's easy for you to say.

594
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,399
A sugar daddy is dealing drugs.

595
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,153
She said, did or saw something
she wasn't supposed to.

596
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:46,656
He pitches her off the balcony
into the sweet by-and-by.

597
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:50,035
That's why he came at us
with a shotgun today.

598
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:54,330
I'm sorry. It's just a little too neat.
I can't swallow it.

599
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:58,626
Of course it's neat.
What's wrong with neat? I like neat.

600
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:02,380
By neat, you mean simple.

601
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,676
- You okay?
- Watch out!

602
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,845
What button did you push?

603
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:11,723
Where's my manual?

604
00:48:13,183 --> 00:48:15,477
Is this what you're looking for, captain?

605
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:17,020
You asshole!

606
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:21,691
Daddy? Didn't mean to interrupt
an intellectual conversation...

607
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:24,819
Mark asked me to a club tomorrow night.

608
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:28,198
- You're grounded. You know that.
- Please, Daddy?

609
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:29,532
Which one is Mark?

610
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:32,160
- The blond one.
- With pits in his face?

611
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,079
Those are dimples.

612
00:48:34,329 --> 00:48:38,333
Pits. When he smiles, I can see
through his head. The answer is no.

613
00:48:38,875 --> 00:48:40,085
Have a heart, Rog.

614
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:43,838
Hey, buddy. She smoked pot
in the house. She's grounded.

615
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:47,842
Why can I have a beer
and I can't smoke a joint?

616
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,344
It's not coke, you know.

617
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:53,389
I'll tell you why.
Because now, at this moment...

618
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:56,893
...beer is legal, grass ain't.
Right or wrong?

619
00:48:57,352 --> 00:48:59,354
- It's wrong.
- Right.

620
00:48:59,729 --> 00:49:01,189
Right.

621
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:08,363
They sit there drinking
six-packs and I get grounded.

622
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:11,533
I'm gonna go home.

623
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:14,661
Did we resolve anything here tonight?

624
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:16,788
Yeah, we resolved plenty.

625
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:20,375
We know your wife takes out the garbage...

626
00:49:20,708 --> 00:49:23,378
...your daughter smokes grass
and it's illegal...

627
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:27,590
...and you don't know
a lot about boats.

628
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:34,389
You got a hell of a nice family there.

629
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,723
Thank you.

630
00:49:36,558 --> 00:49:38,601
I enjoyed the meal. Thanks a lot.

631
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:42,105
Bullshit. But thanks anyway.

632
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:50,238
You don't trust me at all, do you?

633
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:56,452
I tell you what. You make it through
tomorrow without killing anybody...

634
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,623
...especially me or yourself,
then I'll start trusting you.

635
00:50:02,917 --> 00:50:04,294
Fair enough.

636
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:10,925
I do it real good, you know.

637
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,510
Do what?

638
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:19,976
When I was 19, I did a guy
in Laos from 1000 yards out.

639
00:50:20,435 --> 00:50:22,645
A rifle shot in high wind.

640
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,608
Maybe eight...

641
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,320
...or even ten guys in the world
could have made that shot.

642
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:37,452
It's the only thing I was ever good at.

643
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:41,164
See you tomorrow.

644
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:44,751
Yeah, see you.

645
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:46,961
Hey, Riggs...

646
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,463
Yo.

647
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:53,718
You really like my wife's cooking?

648
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:01,309
No.

649
00:51:02,477 --> 00:51:03,728
See you tomorrow.

650
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:31,172
Get out of there, Burbank.

651
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,735
This is cute.

652
00:51:56,531 --> 00:51:59,200
What have we got here?
"Police evidence."

653
00:53:37,173 --> 00:53:39,801
Morning, Roger.
Here, have some coffee.

654
00:53:40,343 --> 00:53:45,139
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

655
00:53:45,473 --> 00:53:47,423
- How did you get in?
- Trish let me in.

656
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:49,519
- What time is it?
- Daytime.

657
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,647
The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she...

658
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:56,150
What was the name of that hooker
who witnessed the jump?

659
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:59,862
Come on, we got to get up
and catch bad guys today.

660
00:54:00,154 --> 00:54:01,656
I'll get a shower.

661
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,700
What was the name of that hooker?

662
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:08,287
- Century City isn't her turf.
- Her name is Dixie!

663
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:12,333
Give me that cup.
And get out of here!

664
00:54:16,671 --> 00:54:19,715
Someone was in bed with Amanda
the night she died.

665
00:54:20,007 --> 00:54:22,176
Until now, we assumed it was a man.

666
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,178
Suppose it was Dixie.

667
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:28,683
Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie
put the drain cleaner in her pills.

668
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,351
Say someone paid her.

669
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,440
She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple
downers and she's dead." Then Dixie...

670
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:37,024
If it was her.

671
00:54:37,191 --> 00:54:42,280
If it was her. She's got plenty of time
to spritz the place up and get out.

672
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:44,532
But Amanda jumps out the window.

673
00:54:44,866 --> 00:54:46,742
Or Dixie pushes her.

674
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:49,912
She has to make a quick exit
because the body's public.

675
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,706
So she hauls ass downstairs.

676
00:54:51,873 --> 00:54:53,875
People are saying, "What happened?"

677
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,502
Somebody spots her,
and she says, "Shit!"

678
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,005
That's right, she says, "Shit!"

679
00:54:59,255 --> 00:55:02,258
The point being that now
she has to cover her ass.

680
00:55:04,218 --> 00:55:08,890
So she grabs a flatfoot and says,
"Officer, I saw the whole thing."

681
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:11,559
Right.

682
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:13,853
Right.

683
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:17,023
That's pretty fucking thin.

684
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,483
That's very thin.

685
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:20,485
Thin's my middle name.

686
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:23,154
Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.

687
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:26,157
- What?
- Nothing.

688
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:29,243
Those remarks won't get you
invited to Christmas dinner.

689
00:55:30,328 --> 00:55:33,039
My luck's changing
for the better every day.

690
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,752
All right, baby, come to Roger.

691
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,589
Center mass.

692
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,639
Read them and weep.

693
00:55:52,934 --> 00:55:55,144
Do you sleep with that thing?

694
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:57,188
I would if I slept.

695
00:55:57,522 --> 00:56:00,691
Step back. Let me show
what an old man can do.

696
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:03,819
Just warming up, just warming up.

697
00:56:11,452 --> 00:56:13,037
Watch carefully.

698
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:30,137
Hey! Look at that, will you?
Not bad for an old man.

699
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,807
Step aside, old man.

700
00:57:28,988 --> 00:57:30,781
Have a nice day.

701
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,913
Shit!

702
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:44,295
Uh-oh! The policemen are here!

703
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:48,299
Yeah, you're right.
Hello, policemen!

704
00:57:50,134 --> 00:57:51,218
Hi.

705
00:57:51,886 --> 00:57:52,887
Hi.

706
00:57:53,512 --> 00:57:55,389
- How you doing?
- Fine.

707
00:57:55,598 --> 00:57:58,267
Are you going to bust Dixie?

708
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,312
We're just going over there
for a cup of coffee.

709
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:03,731
We're going over here to have breakfast.

710
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,233
You're gonna bust Dixie!

711
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,903
You're gonna bust Dixie!

712
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:11,447
You're gonna bust Dixie!

713
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:14,075
You're gonna bust Dixie!

714
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:17,453
- Like I said, thin.
- Probably nothing.

715
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:32,843
Did you see that? Wasn't that great?

716
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,057
What are you, a fag?

717
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:39,934
Your coat's on fire!

718
00:58:44,313 --> 00:58:47,650
- Probably nothing.
- Thin. Very thin.

719
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,655
You guys okay? Got all
your fingers and toes?

720
00:58:52,947 --> 00:58:55,074
Three-William-56.

721
00:58:55,324 --> 00:58:58,285
We got a fire and explosion
at 111th and Larch.

722
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,455
Request ambulance and fire department.

723
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,208
Do it again! Do it again!

724
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,461
- Give me a break, guys.
- Enough, enough!

725
00:59:07,712 --> 00:59:09,964
Do you think Dixie was home?

726
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:22,393
What you got?

727
00:59:23,644 --> 00:59:24,979
Part of the device.

728
00:59:25,312 --> 00:59:27,732
This is artwork.
This is goddamn artwork.

729
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:33,112
This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen
anything like this since the war.

730
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:37,908
The CIA used to hire mercs.
They used the exact same setup.

731
00:59:38,159 --> 00:59:41,120
Mercury switches, gaflooey!
That's heavy shit.

732
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:42,413
Guys!

733
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:45,666
We got something.
The detective wants to see you.

734
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:56,886
Okay, here it is.

735
00:59:57,178 --> 00:59:58,888
Some kids playing this morning...

736
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:01,223
...one saw a guy checking the meter.

737
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,642
- Where?
- Here at Dixie's.

738
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:08,189
He was playing under the porch.
Says he saw the guy pretty good.

739
01:00:08,439 --> 01:00:11,901
- It could be a break.
- Those kids are 6 years old.

740
01:00:12,151 --> 01:00:14,653
- You call the gas company?
- Sure did.

741
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,574
No one's supposed to check
that meter for at least a month.

742
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,037
- Let me handle this.
- Be my guest.

743
01:00:23,204 --> 01:00:25,706
He's the little fellow that saw the guy.

744
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,710
My name is Detective Murtaugh.
What's yours?

745
01:00:29,877 --> 01:00:33,214
- Don't tell him your name.
- He'll put you in jail.

746
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,715
You won't see your mom.

747
01:00:35,049 --> 01:00:38,886
It's all right. I won't
put you in jail. What's your name?

748
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:42,223
- Don't tell him, Alfred.
- Alfred!

749
01:00:42,681 --> 01:00:45,976
This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.
This is Alfred.

750
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:48,896
Alfred, hi! How old are you?

751
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,397
Six.

752
01:00:50,773 --> 01:00:54,401
Six years old. I bet you like Go-Bots.

753
01:00:54,610 --> 01:00:56,070
Is that a real gun?

754
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:58,447
Yeah, this is a real gun.

755
01:00:58,906 --> 01:01:00,074
Do you kill people?

756
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:04,703
No. If some guy is hurting someone,
I try to shoot him in the leg...

757
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:06,288
...just to stop him.

758
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:09,083
Mama says policemen shoot black people.

759
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:11,252
- Is it true?
- Yeah, is it true?

760
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,254
Is that true?

761
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,092
Maybe we ought to get the kids some...

762
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:19,718
Ice cream.

763
01:01:20,135 --> 01:01:21,220
You like ice cream?

764
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:24,014
Yeah! Ice cream!

765
01:01:27,726 --> 01:01:30,312
No, not you, Alfred.

766
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,274
Now, Alfred...

767
01:01:34,525 --> 01:01:37,862
The man you saw,
did you get a good look at him?

768
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:40,447
- I saw him.
- Great!

769
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:45,327
Picture him in your head.
Close your eyes.

770
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:48,163
Think what he looks like.

771
01:01:48,497 --> 01:01:49,623
Got it?

772
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:51,542
Can you draw him?

773
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,046
Give me some drawing paper and crayons.

774
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,799
- This is good.
- Can it, man.

775
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:01,385
We're gonna put out an APB on Big Bird.

776
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:04,555
"All units. Large
yellow bird, silly voice."

777
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,808
You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.

778
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,768
Tell me what he looks like.

779
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:12,021
Was he black?

780
01:02:13,272 --> 01:02:14,315
Was he white?

781
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:18,777
Was he tall?

782
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:21,030
Tall like me?

783
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:23,324
What color was his hair? Brown?

784
01:02:24,575 --> 01:02:26,035
Black?

785
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:28,037
Blond?

786
01:02:28,287 --> 01:02:29,788
His hair was blond.

787
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:34,335
What did he have on?
Did he have jeans on?

788
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:35,794
It was paint.

789
01:02:36,003 --> 01:02:37,296
Pained?

790
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:38,923
I don't know.

791
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:40,883
Pain...

792
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:42,468
Painted?

793
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:45,596
Painted. A tattoo?

794
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:50,517
Like Popeye?
A tattoo like Popeye? No?

795
01:02:51,602 --> 01:02:52,811
It was that.

796
01:02:55,314 --> 01:02:56,732
Like that?

797
01:02:57,399 --> 01:02:58,901
Exactly like that?

798
01:03:00,569 --> 01:03:02,863
I saw it good. This is it.

799
01:03:03,072 --> 01:03:04,448
I remember.

800
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:06,200
Are you sure?

801
01:03:06,742 --> 01:03:08,035
It had a knife, even.

802
01:03:19,588 --> 01:03:22,591
Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.

803
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:25,260
- Really?
- Yeah.

804
01:03:26,345 --> 01:03:29,765
A Special Forces tattoo,
mercury switches...

805
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:35,980
What the hell have we gotten into here?

806
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:38,357
Yeah. Here.

807
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:42,611
Wonder if there's an opening
in the fire department?

808
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:54,121
Want to tell me about it?

809
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:56,917
- About what?
- Don't bullshit me.

810
01:03:57,126 --> 01:04:00,587
Your daughter wasn't killed
for something she was into.

811
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,007
She was killed for something you're into.

812
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:05,968
Stop me if I'm wrong.

813
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:09,388
I don't know what you mean.

814
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:13,475
Keep your hands
away from your pocket, okay?

815
01:04:14,101 --> 01:04:15,978
- Easy, man.
- Fuck easy.

816
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:22,443
You called me the other day
to blow the whistle, right?

817
01:04:23,152 --> 01:04:24,778
Blow the whistle on what?

818
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:28,282
You were going to spill your guts,
so they killed your daughter.

819
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:31,160
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Talk to me!

820
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,662
They killed your daughter.

821
01:04:33,954 --> 01:04:37,041
They paid off a hooker to poison
your little girl.

822
01:04:37,291 --> 01:04:39,334
Chrissake!
I've got another daughter.

823
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:42,921
- She'll be protected.
- You don't know these people.

824
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:45,174
Acquaint me with them.

825
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,471
It goes back to the war.

826
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:57,936
I worked with a group called
Air America. CIA front.

827
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:02,816
They secretly ran
the entire war out of Laos.

828
01:05:03,525 --> 01:05:07,696
I was with a special unit called
Shadow Company. Trained killers.

829
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:11,533
When Charlie brought in heroin
to finance the VC government...

830
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,578
...Shadow Company burned
the whole thing down.

831
01:05:15,037 --> 01:05:16,872
We killed everybody.

832
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,670
We also formed a plan.

833
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:25,214
Keep talking.

834
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:34,848
A few years ago, Shadow Company
got together again.

835
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:36,892
The war was over.

836
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:41,480
- But we still had our sources in Asia.
- And?

837
01:05:42,064 --> 01:05:43,914
We've been bringing it in ever since.

838
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:45,526
Bringing in what?

839
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:47,986
Heroin.

840
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:50,697
Two major shipments a year.

841
01:05:54,076 --> 01:05:56,495
It's all run by ex-CIA.

842
01:05:57,246 --> 01:05:59,248
Soldiers, mercs.

843
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,209
You son of a bitch!

844
01:06:02,376 --> 01:06:06,296
If you had cold feet, why did
they kill Amanda? Why not you?

845
01:06:06,547 --> 01:06:08,924
- They can't. They need me.
- Why?

846
01:06:09,216 --> 01:06:14,221
My company is a perfect front. Makes
everything look great on tax reports.

847
01:06:17,933 --> 01:06:20,269
This is big business, Roger.

848
01:06:25,107 --> 01:06:26,650
Not anymore.

849
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,778
I'm gonna burn it down.

850
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:31,822
You can't. It's too big.

851
01:06:32,406 --> 01:06:35,409
These people are trained, expert killers.

852
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:40,080
Tell me about your next shipment:
Where it's coming in, how many...

853
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:42,958
I can't tell you that, Roger.
I can't.

854
01:06:43,625 --> 01:06:48,255
I have another daughter. You can't
protect her. I'm in this too deep.

855
01:07:07,566 --> 01:07:11,153
Heroin.
You got off easy, you son of a bitch!

856
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:33,008
You through?

857
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,177
I haven't even started.

858
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:40,015
<i>Gen. McAllister, this is
Delta One. We're coming in. Over.</i>

859
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:42,824
- Your mission is accomplished?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

860
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:45,604
<i>Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.</i>

861
01:07:45,854 --> 01:07:48,732
<i>I'm afraid, however,
that another problem exists.</i>

862
01:07:48,982 --> 01:07:50,609
<i>What is it? Explain.</i>

863
01:07:50,817 --> 01:07:52,819
<i>Hunsaker spoke to the police.</i>

864
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:56,406
<i>- Are they dead?
- No, I missed the opportunity.</i>

865
01:07:56,657 --> 01:08:00,535
<i>Very disappointing. So the
police may know the whole operation?</i>

866
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,412
<i>That is correct, sir.</i>

867
01:08:03,038 --> 01:08:05,415
Joshua, it's time we turned up the heat.

868
01:08:05,666 --> 01:08:07,125
Come on home.

869
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:25,185
- Hi.
- Hi.

870
01:08:25,394 --> 01:08:28,355
What's a nice Irish girl
like you doing out here?

871
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:31,650
I'm looking for a guy,
had this girl in his stable.

872
01:08:31,858 --> 01:08:34,903
- Never seen her.
- She's in your line of work. You sure?

873
01:08:35,195 --> 01:08:37,698
- Sure. Why?
- I'm a police officer.

874
01:08:37,906 --> 01:08:40,575
Don't worry, I won't drag your
ass to jail...

875
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,479
You wore your vest.

876
01:09:10,564 --> 01:09:12,899
That was smart, kid. Come on.

877
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:17,446
Hold on! I'm on your side.

878
01:09:20,115 --> 01:09:22,576
Son of a bitch, that hurts!

879
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,704
I'm pissed, Roger! Now I'm pissed.

880
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:28,915
Look at your face!

881
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:31,418
Two inches higher,
he'd have hit your head.

882
01:09:31,585 --> 01:09:34,212
Two inches lower,
I'd be a falsetto for life.

883
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,298
I bet you'd sound nice too.

884
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,093
- Where's my gun?
- Here.

885
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:44,848
Oh, shit! Roger!

886
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:47,768
The guy who shot me...

887
01:09:48,435 --> 01:09:51,938
The same albino jackrabbit
son of a bitch that did Hunsaker.

888
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,774
- You sure?
- I'm sure, man.

889
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:55,942
I never forget an asshole.

890
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,861
I got an idea.

891
01:09:58,612 --> 01:10:02,282
We fly first class to Detroit
and lay low for a couple weeks.

892
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:04,826
Come on, be serious.
What do we do?

893
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,161
What else?

894
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:09,122
We bury the fuckers.
And you know what else?

895
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:13,460
We do this right, we get famous.
Do shaving ads. Girls. Money.

896
01:10:14,252 --> 01:10:16,880
With our luck, we'll do
Forest Lawn commercials.

897
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,383
Bullshit! We got the edge.

898
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:24,137
Roger, they think I'm dead.
I'm a corpse.

899
01:10:30,352 --> 01:10:31,812
Brilliant.

900
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,565
Brilliant shit!

901
01:10:38,026 --> 01:10:40,278
- 3-William-56.
<i>- We got a body for you.</i>

902
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:44,032
He was at Hunsaker's place.
I saw him, he saw me.

903
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:46,284
Get someone else to do it, okay?

904
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:50,705
<i>Captain says give it to you.
About two blocks from your house.</i>

905
01:10:51,206 --> 01:10:54,918
Yeah, sure. He's probably blond
with big dimples.

906
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:57,587
<i>How did you know that, sarge?</i>

907
01:10:59,548 --> 01:11:01,591
- Get in here!
- What's the matter?

908
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:02,926
Trouble.

909
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:10,183
They just gave a description
of the kid my daughter's dating.

910
01:11:37,627 --> 01:11:39,838
Let's be dark and quiet.

911
01:12:03,945 --> 01:12:06,072
One, two...

912
01:12:21,129 --> 01:12:23,381
The bastards got my daughter.

913
01:12:34,768 --> 01:12:35,769
What is it?

914
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:37,395
Nothing.

915
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:39,105
- What is it?
- Nothing!

916
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,108
Get back in your room.
Back in your room!

917
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,167
Murtaugh.

918
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,419
<i>You have a beautiful daughter.</i>

919
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:05,048
<i>I'd stick by the phone to find out
where to meet us.</i>

920
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,806
They got my kid.

921
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,643
Bastards took my baby.

922
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:42,752
<i>Sgt. McCaskey, pick up line three.</i>

923
01:13:43,587 --> 01:13:45,338
Homicide, McCaskey speaking.

924
01:13:45,547 --> 01:13:46,881
This is KCOP news.

925
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:51,511
We heard an officer was shot tonight.
Can you give us more information?

926
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,515
Sgt. Martin Riggs was shot and killed.
Who is this?

927
01:13:55,682 --> 01:13:57,684
We'll send somebody right over.

928
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:04,691
Bingo! Riggs is out of the picture.

929
01:14:05,108 --> 01:14:06,860
I want Murtaugh taken alive.

930
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:08,862
He may not talk.

931
01:14:10,113 --> 01:14:12,032
We have his little girl.
He'll talk.

932
01:14:28,131 --> 01:14:31,009
You know they're gonna kill her,
don't you?

933
01:14:31,635 --> 01:14:32,636
Yes.

934
01:14:34,262 --> 01:14:38,725
And if you want her back,
you'll have to take her away from them.

935
01:14:39,059 --> 01:14:40,310
I know.

936
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:49,653
We do this my way.
You shoot and you shoot to kill.

937
01:14:50,153 --> 01:14:54,616
Get as many as you can.
All you got to do is just not miss.

938
01:14:54,824 --> 01:14:56,409
I won't miss.

939
01:14:58,411 --> 01:15:01,289
We're going to get bloody on this one.

940
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:07,170
Are you really crazy?

941
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:12,258
Or are you as good as you say you are?

942
01:15:14,344 --> 01:15:16,262
You're gonna have to trust me.

943
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,601
Here we go.

944
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:28,066
Murtaugh.

945
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:32,570
<i>We don't want your daughter.
We want to know what Hunsaker told you.</i>

946
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:36,783
<i>Dry lake. Victorville.
Sunrise tomorrow. Be there.</i>

947
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:43,344
Murtaugh!

948
01:18:43,970 --> 01:18:45,388
Yes, that's right.

949
01:18:45,638 --> 01:18:47,640
Show me my daughter!

950
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:50,768
Let me see her, then I'll come quietly.

951
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:59,402
He wants to see the girl.

952
01:18:59,652 --> 01:19:00,862
Get out.

953
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:07,785
Daddy!

954
01:19:08,286 --> 01:19:10,580
Okay, baby! I'm here.

955
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,999
Okay, it's all right.

956
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:14,208
Simple exchange.

957
01:19:15,293 --> 01:19:18,838
You come with us, the girl takes a walk.

958
01:19:19,088 --> 01:19:20,548
Let her go now.

959
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:26,387
As I say, take your hands
out of your pockets.

960
01:19:26,596 --> 01:19:28,306
Sure thing, pal.

961
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,102
It's alive.

962
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:38,232
Let her go now, or we all die.

963
01:19:39,067 --> 01:19:40,193
Take him!

964
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:41,736
He has a grenade!

965
01:19:42,028 --> 01:19:44,948
He's bluffing!
He wouldn't risk killing his daughter.

966
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:47,325
If she's gonna die...

967
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,954
...she's gonna die with me.
My way, not yours.

968
01:19:56,125 --> 01:20:00,546
Come on, Roger, get out of the way.
Move to your left. Come on!

969
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:02,215
Put the pin back in.

970
01:20:02,715 --> 01:20:06,552
Officer Murtaugh, don't be foolish.
Look at the hardware.

971
01:20:06,886 --> 01:20:08,554
Move to your left.

972
01:20:14,227 --> 01:20:17,730
Look at the firepower.
You're grounded. Riggs is gone.

973
01:20:18,064 --> 01:20:20,233
Put the pin back in the grenade.

974
01:20:20,441 --> 01:20:22,068
If you come closer...

975
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:23,861
...then we all die.

976
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:27,073
I don't think so.

977
01:20:28,950 --> 01:20:30,076
Daddy!

978
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:36,874
Come on, honey.

979
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:39,919
Just a smoker.

980
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,421
Bingo.

981
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,469
- Where is he?
- It's Riggs.

982
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:53,266
Rianne, get in the car!

983
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:56,602
Get in the fucking car!

984
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,122
Go, Rianne, go!

985
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:19,167
Come on, cottontail, stick your head up.

986
01:21:20,626 --> 01:21:23,129
That's it, you son of a bitch.
Good night.

987
01:21:26,799 --> 01:21:29,510
Don't try it, son.
You're not that fast.

988
01:21:31,512 --> 01:21:33,347
<i>Hello, Joshua. Hello, Joshua.</i>

989
01:21:33,556 --> 01:21:35,308
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I got Riggs.</i>

990
01:21:36,142 --> 01:21:38,811
He's got Riggs. Go get the girl!

991
01:22:14,222 --> 01:22:16,224
Throw your weapon down!

992
01:22:16,516 --> 01:22:18,851
Put your hands behind your head!

993
01:22:22,897 --> 01:22:26,567
You're Gen. Peter McAllister,
commander of Shadow Company.

994
01:22:27,026 --> 01:22:29,695
I see we've heard of each other.

995
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:33,407
Yep. It'll almost be a shame
when I nail you.

996
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:38,704
I ran into some of those Shadow Company
pussies in Saigon in '69.

997
01:22:38,996 --> 01:22:40,248
You did, did you?

998
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:29,255
Leave me alone!

999
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,284
Save your strength.
You'll need it.

1000
01:23:58,618 --> 01:23:59,619
Who's the Chin?

1001
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:03,456
Endo, meet Mr. Martin Riggs.

1002
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:07,501
Endo has forgotten more
about dispensing pain...

1003
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:08,961
...than we'll ever know.

1004
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:10,630
Terrific.

1005
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:12,632
See, we have a problem.

1006
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:14,634
Since we have Murtaugh...

1007
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:16,469
...we don't need you.

1008
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:20,139
- I believe in being thorough.
- I've heard that about you.

1009
01:24:22,350 --> 01:24:25,019
Our problem, and yours too...

1010
01:24:25,811 --> 01:24:28,814
...is we have a shipment
of merchandise to deliver.

1011
01:24:28,981 --> 01:24:30,858
Why don't you just call it heroin?

1012
01:24:32,526 --> 01:24:34,904
It's rather large, this shipment.

1013
01:24:35,863 --> 01:24:37,823
It would be unfortunate...

1014
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:40,743
...if we showed up
to deliver our heroin...

1015
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,162
...and were surrounded by 50 cops.

1016
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:44,622
That would be too bad.

1017
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:46,374
Yes, it would be.

1018
01:24:47,333 --> 01:24:50,253
So we have to find out all the cops know.

1019
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:53,422
We don't know shit.
You did Hunsaker before he could say...

1020
01:24:53,673 --> 01:24:55,049
No! No!

1021
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:59,345
I wish I could believe you.
Unfortunately, I don't.

1022
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:07,353
Now, if you tell me everything you know...

1023
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:09,897
...I promise you I'll kill you quick.

1024
01:25:12,066 --> 01:25:13,859
I told you everything I know.

1025
01:25:17,196 --> 01:25:18,197
Endo?

1026
01:25:21,033 --> 01:25:22,535
What is that thing?

1027
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:25,871
I'll tell you.

1028
01:25:26,789 --> 01:25:28,874
It's electric shock treatment.

1029
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:33,921
We're in for a long night,
because I don't know shit.

1030
01:25:36,257 --> 01:25:37,675
We'll see.

1031
01:25:41,304 --> 01:25:42,555
Son of a bitch!

1032
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:47,351
Hit him again!

1033
01:25:57,361 --> 01:25:58,362
Again!

1034
01:26:03,743 --> 01:26:05,244
Tell me about the shipment!

1035
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:10,249
I'm gonna fucking kill both of you!

1036
01:26:10,458 --> 01:26:12,835
Very funny.
What about the shipment?

1037
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,593
The shipment, Mr. Murtaugh.

1038
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,928
Go spit!

1039
01:26:24,138 --> 01:26:25,139
Salt.

1040
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:44,492
Go spit, you son of a bitch.
Fuck you!

1041
01:26:45,326 --> 01:26:46,952
This is getting nowhere.

1042
01:26:47,161 --> 01:26:48,329
Mr. Large.

1043
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:56,962
He knows shit. We're safe.

1044
01:26:57,129 --> 01:27:00,007
He'd have told us.
Nobody can take that.

1045
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:02,051
Fine.

1046
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:03,677
Badass soldier, huh?

1047
01:27:07,807 --> 01:27:09,308
Daddy!

1048
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:19,485
Get her up.

1049
01:27:24,657 --> 01:27:27,326
Untie me and I'll kill
all of you bastards!

1050
01:27:27,493 --> 01:27:29,286
Tell me what you know.

1051
01:27:29,495 --> 01:27:32,164
Fuck you, bastard!
I'll kill you!

1052
01:27:39,672 --> 01:27:41,424
Sorry, pal.
Say good night.

1053
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:06,532
That's a real good-looking young woman...

1054
01:28:06,740 --> 01:28:09,118
...you got there, Mr. Murtaugh.

1055
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:13,287
I've told you everything.

1056
01:28:13,456 --> 01:28:14,957
We'll soon know, won't we?

1057
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,750
I'm warning you.

1058
01:28:17,126 --> 01:28:18,127
Don't.

1059
01:28:18,544 --> 01:28:20,713
Spare me, son. It's over.

1060
01:28:21,213 --> 01:28:23,716
There's no more heroes left in the world.

1061
01:28:29,138 --> 01:28:30,389
Kill that son of a bitch!

1062
01:28:41,901 --> 01:28:43,569
That asshole's getting away!

1063
01:28:43,777 --> 01:28:45,779
Who's fucking next?

1064
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:47,781
McAllister!

1065
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:49,241
Who's next?

1066
01:28:52,286 --> 01:28:53,913
Pretty thin, huh?

1067
01:28:54,121 --> 01:28:55,581
Anorexic.

1068
01:29:03,088 --> 01:29:05,424
- Let's do what the shepherd did.
- What?

1069
01:29:05,591 --> 01:29:07,426
Get the flock out of here.

1070
01:29:19,313 --> 01:29:20,689
Is it him?

1071
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:23,150
No. It's not Joshua.

1072
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:10,364
Joshua!

1073
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:26,005
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, come on!

1074
01:30:34,013 --> 01:30:36,098
Move it, move it, move it!

1075
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:41,895
Halt! Stop! Stop!

1076
01:30:42,104 --> 01:30:44,857
Get out of the fucking car!
Come on, now!

1077
01:30:47,693 --> 01:30:48,777
Police officers!

1078
01:31:04,084 --> 01:31:05,085
Freeze!

1079
01:31:05,377 --> 01:31:10,257
I'm a police officer. Give me
some backup and take care of the girl.

1080
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,744
Hey, Riggs!

1081
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:39,912
Yo!

1082
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:42,247
He's going for the freeway!

1083
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:44,792
- You okay?
- Yeah!

1084
01:31:47,753 --> 01:31:51,757
Cut over the 3rd Street
bridge! You'll get ahead of him.

1085
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:56,762
General McAllister...

1086
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:00,432
...time for you to die.

1087
01:32:40,013 --> 01:32:41,098
Oh, shit!

1088
01:32:48,856 --> 01:32:50,023
Hold it!

1089
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:11,754
You all right?

1090
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:14,506
Get back in your car!

1091
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,739
Mind if I test-drive your Audi?

1092
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:44,578
Stop the son of a bitch!

1093
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:50,584
Shit!

1094
01:33:50,918 --> 01:33:52,377
Goddamn...

1095
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:54,046
He got my car!

1096
01:33:56,882 --> 01:33:58,967
- Get back!
- Hey, man, I'm cool.

1097
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,730
Let's get out of here!

1098
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:16,735
Open the door!

1099
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:29,081
Kill that cop son of a bitch!

1100
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,919
No way you live. No way.

1101
01:36:00,005 --> 01:36:02,174
- Gangway!
- Hold it now.

1102
01:36:02,424 --> 01:36:04,551
- Police officer.
- Go ahead.

1103
01:36:10,015 --> 01:36:12,851
Well, shit!
What now, kid?

1104
01:36:13,435 --> 01:36:16,063
First thing, we get you to hospital.

1105
01:36:16,605 --> 01:36:18,315
Come on. Let's go.

1106
01:36:19,358 --> 01:36:22,110
- Don't breathe this stuff.
- And Joshua?

1107
01:36:22,361 --> 01:36:24,363
The slippery son of a bitch got away!

1108
01:36:24,571 --> 01:36:27,240
- What do you mean he got away?
- Hey, fire me.

1109
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:30,202
- Shit!
- Hold on a second.

1110
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,578
Where you going?

1111
01:36:31,912 --> 01:36:33,789
Sarge, I'm commandeering your car.

1112
01:36:34,039 --> 01:36:35,374
What's the matter?

1113
01:36:35,540 --> 01:36:38,126
My home!
The son of a bitch knows where I live.

1114
01:36:38,377 --> 01:36:40,212
I'll drive, Cochise.

1115
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:43,924
- I got to look at him!
- He's all right.

1116
01:36:47,302 --> 01:36:50,055
3-W-30 en route to
Sgt. Murtaugh's residence.

1117
01:36:50,305 --> 01:36:52,599
Requesting additional units.

1118
01:37:26,425 --> 01:37:28,260
Excuse me, sir.
May we help you?

1119
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:29,761
No, thank you.

1120
01:37:57,122 --> 01:37:58,957
<i>Good morning, sir.</i>

1121
01:38:00,167 --> 01:38:02,335
<i>Tell me, what day is it?</i>

1122
01:38:03,712 --> 01:38:05,380
Goddamn Christmas!

1123
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:09,384
I'll give you a home to come back to.

1124
01:38:27,486 --> 01:38:29,696
Crazy son of a bitch!

1125
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:50,884
Give me that. Drop it.

1126
01:39:00,644 --> 01:39:02,145
Looking for the general?

1127
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:07,400
He's barbecuing his nuts
on Hollywood Boulevard.

1128
01:39:15,200 --> 01:39:17,035
What do you say, Jack?

1129
01:39:18,036 --> 01:39:19,746
Like a shot at the title?

1130
01:39:20,747 --> 01:39:22,415
Don't mind if I do.

1131
01:39:39,099 --> 01:39:43,562
Okay, men! I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
My responsibility here!

1132
01:39:44,312 --> 01:39:45,981
<i>Watch commander is en route.</i>

1133
01:39:46,231 --> 01:39:49,734
<i>Until then, Sgt. Murtaugh
is in charge on site.</i>

1134
01:39:53,905 --> 01:39:55,949
Just keep the citizens clear.

1135
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:09,713
Keep everyone back!

1136
01:40:17,929 --> 01:40:20,932
It's Sgt. Riggs' arrest.
I take full responsibility!

1137
01:40:21,099 --> 01:40:23,476
The son of a bitch killed two of our men!

1138
01:40:29,441 --> 01:40:30,942
Get him, kid!
He's yours!

1139
01:40:45,832 --> 01:40:47,626
Come on, Riggs! Come on!

1140
01:40:56,134 --> 01:40:58,845
You wanna quit now?
You wanna quit?

1141
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:11,358
Give me your nightstick!
Riggs!

1142
01:41:20,408 --> 01:41:21,493
Come on!

1143
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:23,703
Show me what you got!

1144
01:41:30,669 --> 01:41:32,170
Eat this, sucker!

1145
01:41:57,862 --> 01:41:58,905
Let them take him!

1146
01:41:59,906 --> 01:42:01,408
Let me take him!

1147
01:42:03,576 --> 01:42:05,203
No! Back off!

1148
01:42:43,950 --> 01:42:45,368
Break his fucking neck!

1149
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:54,461
It's not worth it.

1150
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:01,885
You lose.

1151
01:43:10,477 --> 01:43:12,645
Get that shit off my lawn!

1152
01:43:17,776 --> 01:43:19,152
How you doing, kid?

1153
01:43:44,803 --> 01:43:46,137
I got you.

1154
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:48,014
I got you, partner.

1155
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:27,053
Merry Christmas, Victoria Lynn.

1156
01:44:28,847 --> 01:44:30,098
I love you.

1157
01:44:53,288 --> 01:44:55,039
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1158
01:44:55,248 --> 01:44:56,416
How are you?

1159
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,419
I'm going to be all right. You?

1160
01:44:59,794 --> 01:45:01,087
I'm good.

1161
01:45:04,257 --> 01:45:06,134
Give this to your dad, okay?

1162
01:45:06,509 --> 01:45:09,637
It's a present for him.
Tell him I won't need it anymore.

1163
01:45:10,430 --> 01:45:13,516
- It's a bullet.
- Yeah, it's a bullet.

1164
01:45:14,267 --> 01:45:15,810
He'll understand.

1165
01:45:17,562 --> 01:45:19,606
You want to come in?
We're building.

1166
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:23,568
No, I gotta go.

1167
01:45:25,904 --> 01:45:27,947
You have a nice Christmas, though.

1168
01:45:28,531 --> 01:45:29,782
Okay. You too.

1169
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:31,784
Okay. Bye.

1170
01:45:32,118 --> 01:45:33,286
Bye.

1171
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:42,962
Riggs!

1172
01:45:48,301 --> 01:45:50,428
After all we've been through...

1173
01:45:50,595 --> 01:45:54,807
...if you think I'm gonna eat
the world's lousiest turkey by myself...

1174
01:45:55,099 --> 01:45:56,184
...you're crazy.

1175
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:00,188
- I'll tell you a little secret.
- What?

1176
01:46:00,438 --> 01:46:01,773
I'm not crazy.

1177
01:46:04,275 --> 01:46:05,276
I know.

1178
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,320
Oh, good. Let's eat.

1179
01:46:08,947 --> 01:46:10,448
Hey, you know something?

1180
01:46:10,657 --> 01:46:12,617
I think your daughter likes me.

1181
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:15,286
- If you touch her, I'll kill you.
- You'll try.

1182
01:46:15,495 --> 01:46:18,623
- You mind if I bring a friend?
- Of course, bring a friend.

1183
01:46:27,173 --> 01:46:29,384
I don't think the cat will like this.

1184
01:46:29,634 --> 01:46:31,678
I'll put five on the mutt.

1185
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:42,814
I'm too old for this.
