00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:21,185
<i>There was a time above.</i>

2
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,855
<i>A time before.</i>

3
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:26,824
<i>There were perfect things,</i>

4
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:29,127
<i>diamond absolutes.</i>

5
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:32,530
<i>How things fall.</i>

6
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,033
<i>Things on earth.</i>

7
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,068
<i>And what falls...</i>

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,169
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:40,004
<i>...is fallen.</i>
Bruce!

10
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,441
<i>Bruce, it's all right.</i>

11
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:47,378
<i>Bruce, please.</i>

12
00:03:10,656 --> 00:03:12,757
Martha.

13
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:48,653
<i>In the dream, they took me to the light.</i>

14
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,554
<i>A beautiful lie.</i>

15
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,168
<i>Jack.</i>
Bruce.

16
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,936
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:38,938 --> 00:05:41,605
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

18
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:43,441
<i>You understand?</i>
Oh, my God.

19
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,142
<i>Stay away from the windows!</i>

20
00:05:45,144 --> 00:05:47,278
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

21
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,380
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,582
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:33,984
<i>We're sorry.</i>

24
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:38,456
<i>All circuits are busy now.
Will you please try your call again later?</i>

25
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,358
Heavenly God,

26
00:07:42,394 --> 00:07:45,329
creator of heaven and earth,

27
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:47,031
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,702
Jack!

29
00:08:30,008 --> 00:08:32,977
Buddy hands! Everybody show me!
Good job!

30
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:34,712
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:36,982 --> 00:08:38,582
<i>Hold on tight.</i>

32
00:08:39,551 --> 00:08:41,018
<i>Come on, guys.</i>

33
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:43,621
Go.

34
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,855
<i>Mr. Wayne!</i>

35
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:48,359
Mr. Wayne!
I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,793
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,029
We need help over here!

38
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,497
Help me.
I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:56,000
You're gonna be okay.
You hear me?

40
00:08:56,002 --> 00:08:58,402
Wallace? What do they
call you, Wally? Huh?

41
00:09:00,505 --> 00:09:01,639
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,476
All right.
You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,011
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:10,181 --> 00:09:12,416
Oh, my God.
I can't move my leg.

45
00:09:12,418 --> 00:09:14,752
<i>My God.
I can't feel my legs.</i>

46
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:24,995
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:28,399
You're okay.
All right? Huh?

48
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,000
You know what?
We're gonna find your Mom.

49
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,635
Where is she?

50
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,193
All that wind is bad luck.

51
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:38,228
Blood in the sky.

52
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,763
Oh, there she is!

53
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:49,239
Miss Lane.

54
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,710
<i>Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.</i>

55
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,878
Photographer. Obviously.

56
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,313
Where's Heron?

57
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:58,115
Uh, trouble at the border.

58
00:12:00,251 --> 00:12:03,387
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

59
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,723
Amajagh's never given an interview.

60
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,975
You know what heron always says
when we're on assignment together?

61
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,662
Not a goddamn thing.

62
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,797
I like Heron.

63
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,746
Let's go.

64
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,521
<i>Passports.
Electronics. Phones. Camera.</i>

65
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:40,090
Your fixer said that
the General approved photos.

66
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:07,117
Um...

67
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:11,922
Are you a terrorist, General?

68
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:14,758
They did not tell me the
interview was with a lady.

69
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,060
I'm not a lady.
I'm a journalist.

70
00:13:19,464 --> 00:13:23,100
<i>What I am is a man with nothing</i>

71
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,804
<i>except a love of my people.</i>

72
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,806
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

73
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,708
Who pays for the drones that
pass over our heads at night?

74
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,112
<i>One question begs another.</i>

75
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,780
<i>Yes?</i>

76
00:13:36,782 --> 00:13:38,615
<i>Say what you're saying, General.</i>

77
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,918
It's just a camera.

78
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,821
The United States has declared its
neutrality in your country's civil war

79
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,790
both in policy and in principle.

80
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:49,560
Oh, don't open...
You just exposed...

81
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,164
These pious American fictions...

82
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,833
<i>...spoken like truth.</i>

83
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,901
Okay. That's my film.

84
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,110
Men with power obey neither
policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

85
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:11,515
<i>No one is different.</i>

86
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:14,618
No one is neutral.

87
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,462
CIA.

88
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,532
They're tracking us!

89
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,434
You!

90
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:35,873
You're CIA?

91
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,407
What? No. No!

92
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,659
You brought him here!
No, he's a photographer.

93
00:14:41,212 --> 00:14:42,880
No!

94
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:49,253
It's okay, Lois.

95
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:08,538
Talon's down, sir.

96
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,741
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

97
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,910
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

98
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,913
There's still a civilian in the compound.
We'll extract her.

99
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,849
<i>Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.</i>

100
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:22,185
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

101
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:24,388
Call off the goddamn drone.

102
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,024
Stand down is an order.
Python?

103
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,659
Let's move!

104
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,535
I...

105
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:39,970
I didn't know.

106
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:44,942
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

107
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,310
Miss Lane.

108
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,540
Get up! Stand up!

109
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:30,821
Quickly. He's coming.

110
00:16:43,634 --> 00:16:45,669
Inbound 2 Mikes.

111
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,171
<i>Passing python now.</i>

112
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,414
Move out!

113
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:07,524
Target locked.
You are clear to engage.

114
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,226
Armed hot and in range.

115
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,966
<i>Three.</i>

116
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:19,903
Two. One.

117
00:17:29,881 --> 00:17:32,049
Link's been hit.

118
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,617
By what?

119
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,589
Take one step,

120
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:41,491
you will see the inside of her head.

121
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:08,011
<i>The women in the village heard a noise.</i>

122
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:13,617
Like the sky cracked open.

123
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:18,321
He came down.
Then came fire.

124
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,659
<i>Even worse came after.</i>

125
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,995
<i>The Government attacked.</i>

126
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,831
<i>No mercy in the villages.</i>

127
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,400
My parents tried to run.

128
00:19:34,872 --> 00:19:38,208
The world has been so caught
up with what Superman can do

129
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,678
that no one has asked what he should do.

130
00:19:43,814 --> 00:19:46,983
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

131
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,152
<i>He'll never answer to you.</i>

132
00:19:49,154 --> 00:19:51,821
He answers to no one.

133
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:54,291
Not even, I think, to God.

134
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,495
<i>58 to nothing.</i>

135
00:19:58,497 --> 00:20:00,697
<i>Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham city.</i>

136
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,166
<i>Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.</i>

137
00:20:03,168 --> 00:20:05,368
<i>Delta Charlie 27. Reports of

139
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:08,838
<i>Tom, it's been great working with you.</i>

140
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,141
<i>I want to thank our producer and director.</i>

141
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,676
<i>Now wait a second.
I don't even want to suggest...</i>

142
00:20:12,678 --> 00:20:13,543
<i>Delta Charlie 27, respond.</i>

143
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,845
Just take a knee.

144
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:17,914
<i>They're lining up as if clarkson
is gonna throw it deep here.</i>

145
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:20,150
<i>- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!</i>

146
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,352
<i>- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.</i>

147
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,187
<i>- Zeke Baker is open.
- Baker with a touchdown catch!</i>

148
00:20:24,189 --> 00:20:25,855
<i>I can't believe I just watched that.</i>

149
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,424
<i>Delta Charlie 27.
Do you copy?</i>

150
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,759
10-4. We're on it.

151
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:31,995
<i>And now a fight breaks out.</i>

152
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,232
<i>Gotham city, you know how they
are about their football team.</i>

153
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,201
<i>Things could get ugly in the city tonight.</i>

154
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:21,611
Go.

155
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,658
It's okay.

156
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,259
It's okay.

157
00:21:36,261 --> 00:21:39,062
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

158
00:21:39,064 --> 00:21:41,498
We're gonna get you
out of here. Okay?

159
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:53,043
I don't understand.

160
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,683
<i>Please don't.
Please don't.</i>

161
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:11,528
<i>Please.

162
00:22:14,632 --> 00:22:16,032
<i>I don't know who he is!</i>

00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,258
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

165
00:23:21,932 --> 00:23:23,533
Christ!

166
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:25,101
I saw him.

167
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,903
<i>I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.</i>

168
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,705
You almost took my face off.

169
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,141
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

170
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:34,377
Oh. Oh.

171
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,679
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

172
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,281
<i>He branded him.</i>

173
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:10,173
Hey.
Hey.

174
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,441
I was gonna cook.

175
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:13,076
Surprise you.

176
00:25:17,848 --> 00:25:20,583
They held hearings about what happened.

177
00:25:21,852 --> 00:25:23,319
<i>They're saying that...</i>
I don't care.

178
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,722
I don't care what they're saying.

179
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:29,292
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

180
00:25:29,294 --> 00:25:30,994
<i>Think of what could have happened.</i>

181
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,463
Well, think about what did happen.

182
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,865
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

183
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,634
<i>If that's what you're saying.</i>

184
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:40,086
No, I'm saying I want to
understand what happened.

185
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,806
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

186
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,608
<i>I'm saying there's a cost.</i>

187
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,553
I just don't know if it's possible.

188
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,455
Don't know if what's possible?

189
00:26:02,693 --> 00:26:04,761
For you to love me and be you.

190
00:26:32,356 --> 00:26:33,756
Clark!

191
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:37,360
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

192
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,529
Mmm-hmm.

193
00:27:12,296 --> 00:27:14,564
You still working?

194
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,966
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

195
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,336
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

196
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:23,039
Even you got too old to die young.

197
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:26,876
And not for lack of trying.

198
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:31,280
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

199
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:33,316
<i>Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry...</i>

200
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,485
There's nothing wrong with the microphone.

201
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:38,621
It's this new layer of armor.

202
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,556
I'll just have to rewire.

203
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:46,996
So, last night was productive?

204
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,933
No. He's too low-level.
He knew nothing.

205
00:27:50,935 --> 00:27:53,369
This is the man who knows things.

206
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:57,273
Anatoli Knyazev.
He's Russian.

207
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,808
Contracts all over the globe,

208
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,176
<i>but he's based out of the port of Gotham.</i>

209
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,978
<i>Weapons and human trafficking.</i>

210
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,846
<i>So the white Portuguese is a Russian.</i>

211
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,982
<i>That's the theory.</i>

212
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:10,620
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

213
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:14,624
If he is, indeed,
a "him."

214
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,025
You don't even know if he exists.

215
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,560
Could be a Phantasm.

216
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:20,797
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

217
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,598
Ah, high-stakes round.

218
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:27,570
<i>New rules.</i>

219
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:32,175
We're criminals, Alfred.

220
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,711
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

221
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:37,880
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

222
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:41,117
Everything's changed.

223
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:47,790
<i>Men fall from the sky.</i>

224
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:51,394
The Gods hurl thunderbolts.

225
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,130
<i>Innocents die.</i>

226
00:28:55,365 --> 00:28:58,034
<i>That's how it starts, sir.</i>

227
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,203
<i>The fever. The rage.</i>

228
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,139
The feeling of powerlessness.

229
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:09,145
It turns good men cruel.

230
00:29:20,424 --> 00:29:23,092
<i>John, get D.</i>

231
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:25,862
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

232
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,930
Man on the Marquee.
Yeah, don't believe it.

233
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,565
My father named the company after himself.

234
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:31,768
He was the Lex in front of
the Corp. How you doin'?

235
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,369
Oh, really great.

236
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,938
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.

237
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,641
No, uh, Dad started saying
that he named the company,

238
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:40,443
uh, after his kid at investor pitches.

239
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,745
Rich old ladies. They thought
it was very cute, you know?

240
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,614
"Write check for Lex."

241
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,784
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

242
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:50,119
He grew up eating, uh, stale crackers.

243
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,321
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

244
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,390
and wave flowers at Tyrants.

245
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:58,127
So, I think it was Providence
that his son, me,

246
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,729
would end up with this.

247
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:02,331
One of my rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

248
00:30:02,333 --> 00:30:04,934
<i>Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian world engine.</i>

249
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:06,769
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

250
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:08,771
Homeland security? Hmm.

251
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,475
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

252
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,510
<i>The fragment is of a
radioactive xenomineral.</i>

253
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,313
<i>We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,</i>

254
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:20,316
so we took the sample to amriid,

255
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:23,452
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

256
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:26,956
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

257
00:30:26,958 --> 00:30:29,158
this happened.

258
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:33,629
<i>Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.</i>

259
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,164
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

260
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,699
if a large enough sample was found.

261
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:40,336
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

262
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,838
<i>Ah!</i>

263
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,340
<i>Lying at the bottom of the Indian ocean.</i>

264
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,509
Emerald city.

265
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,444
<i>Beautiful.</i>

266
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:50,012
<i>Now, rocky is radioactive,</i>

267
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,115
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

268
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:55,852
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

269
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,019
<i>As a deterrent.</i>

270
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,521
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,

271
00:30:58,523 --> 00:30:59,789
to use against the Kryptonians,

272
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,691
so the day does not come, Madam,

273
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,492
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

274
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,194
Last I looked, the only one of those

275
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,829
flying around up here was Superman.

276
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:10,032
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are, uh...

277
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,467
<i>There are more of them.</i>

278
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,835
The metahuman thesis.

279
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:14,237
<i>Yes, the metahuman thesis.</i>

280
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:15,638
<i>More likely than not</i>

281
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,740
these exceptional beings live among us.

282
00:31:17,742 --> 00:31:20,543
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

283
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,044
our little blue planet here.

284
00:31:24,381 --> 00:31:26,182
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

285
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,718
But if you forge one...

286
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,419
Well, then

287
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,089
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

288
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:40,830
There are ways we can help each other.

289
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,065
Would you step into my office here?

290
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:48,704
Yes.

291
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:50,473
What's your wish list?

292
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,610
Uh...

293
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:57,113
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

294
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:00,449
Done.

295
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:52,268
The complete remains of the
dead alien for testing.

296
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,204
You want Zod's body?

297
00:32:56,473 --> 00:32:57,873
Okay.

298
00:33:11,788 --> 00:33:14,657
Mmm.

299
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,244
It's cherry.

300
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,415
Mmm-mmm.

301
00:33:41,451 --> 00:33:43,152
<i>Because the time has come</i>

302
00:33:43,154 --> 00:33:46,455
<i>for the world to hear
the other side of the story.</i>

303
00:33:46,457 --> 00:33:49,692
<i>They say that Superman is a hero.
Okay, but whose hero?</i>

304
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,994
<i>If Superman were here right now,</i>

305
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,130
<i>what would you want to say to him?</i>

306
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,532
<i>That my family, too, had dreams.</i>

307
00:33:58,201 --> 00:34:00,369
<i>To look him in his eye</i>

308
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,472
<i>and ask him how he decides...</i>

309
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:04,874
<i>...which lives count.</i>

310
00:34:05,642 --> 00:34:07,410
<i>And which ones do not.</i>

311
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,014
Sir, get down.

312
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:22,985
Sir, I said get down!

313
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:26,455
<i>Now!</i>

314
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:28,023
<i>Can we get some backup here?</i>

315
00:35:28,959 --> 00:35:30,926
<i>Hey! Hey! Don't do it!</i>

316
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,128
<i>Hey!</i>

317
00:35:34,464 --> 00:35:37,066
Lois! Crime lab, on three.

318
00:35:38,802 --> 00:35:40,269
- This is Lane.
<i>- Kent.</i>

319
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,904
You're sports today.

320
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,106
I want you to go to Gotham,
follow up on football.

321
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:48,911
"Underdog dreams dashed:
Ten yards between Gotham and glory."

322
00:35:48,913 --> 00:35:51,280
Oh, um, watch yourself
over there in Gotham.

323
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,132
Don't let them take your lunch money.

324
00:35:53,917 --> 00:35:55,818

watching this?

No, she's been gone.

<i>What'd she do, officer?</i>

Oh, I'm not a cop.

I'm a reporter.

346

The young lady living here...

She hasn't been back.

348

In fact, if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.

349
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,013
And you need to get out
of here before dark.

<i>Don't listen to that nonsense.</i>

Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.

353
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,755
Scared of who?

354
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,124
There's a new kind of mean in him.

355
00:37:42,926 --> 00:37:44,526
He is angry.

356
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:47,529
And he's hunting.

Thank you.

362
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:38,814
The house treats luck like an insult.

363
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:41,650
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

364
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:47,823
Three nights with a Bolshoi Ballerina,

365
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,591
that line was all she taught me.

366
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:52,594
Not all, I'm sure.
Good evening.

<i>It's like a one-man reign of terror.</i>

00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,841
and the adjacent projects and tenements.

370
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,843
And, as far as I can tell,
the cops are actually helping him.

"Crime wave in Gotham."

"Water, wet."

373
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,617
Did you file the football yet?

374
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:17,519
Why aren't we covering this?

<i>Poor people don't buy papers?</i>

376
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,657
People don't buy papers, period, Kent.

377
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,058
Perry, when you assign a story,

378
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,827
you're making a choice about who matters.

379
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:26,195
And who's worth it.

380
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,996
Good morning, Smallville.

381
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,667
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

382
00:39:31,669 --> 00:39:34,837
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

383
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,940
No match. My guys in the crime
lab never seen one before.

384
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:41,410
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

385
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:42,911
Recovered from the scene

386
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:44,580
of the firefight in the desert.

387
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:46,882
Not sold anywhere
commercially in the world,

388
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,083
even black market.

389
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,485
<i>So?</i>

390
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,387
So who gave prototype military rounds

391
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,855
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

392
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:54,490
You're the reporter.
Tell me.

393
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:56,258
I think that the us government
is arming the rebels

394
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,893
<i>while claiming to support
the elected government.</i>

395
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,561
The ask, Lois.

396
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:06,653
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

397
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:07,836
Go.

398
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,172
Coach. No extra legroom.

399
00:40:12,909 --> 00:40:14,009
Economy plus.

400
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,277
Coach!

401
00:40:16,746 --> 00:40:18,914
So, why didn't you tell me?

402
00:40:21,851 --> 00:40:23,301
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

403
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:26,188
It's kind of dangerous.

404
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,123
That is why I didn't tell you.

405
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:30,025
Lane, don't you have a plane to catch?

406
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:31,660
Yes, sir.

407
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,731
Benefit for the library of Metropolis.

408
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,767
Someone on the committee requested
that Clark Kent cover it.

409
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:42,004
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

410
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:53,782
<i>Senator.</i>

411
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:56,452
Little bourbon before lunch?

412
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,587
My driver's outside.
I can't stay.

413
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,456
No bourbon?

414
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,957
Kentucky girl like yourself?

415
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,460
Hmm.

416
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,329
My Dad always said that Kentucky mash

417
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,298
was the secret to health.

418
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,966
Mmm.

419
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:13,402
This was his room.

420
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:17,172
I kept it just the same.

421
00:41:19,242 --> 00:41:20,476
Mmm.

422
00:41:23,279 --> 00:41:26,815
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back if
I just keep everything the same."

423
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,383
That is silly.

424
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:32,488
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

425
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,224
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

426
00:41:42,999 --> 00:41:44,933
The redcapes are coming.

427
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:48,604
The redcapes are coming.

428
00:41:48,606 --> 00:41:49,671
Hmm...

429
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,209
You and your hearings.

430
00:41:58,214 --> 00:42:00,749
Galloping through the streets to warn us.

431
00:42:02,485 --> 00:42:03,886
One if by land,

432
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:05,888
two if by air.

433
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:07,256
Mmm.

434
00:42:12,028 --> 00:42:15,030
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

435
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,231
Can I call you June?

436
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:19,034
You can call me whatever you like.

437
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:21,737
Take a bucket of piss and
call it granny's peach tea.

438
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,305
Mmm-hmm.

439
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,740
Take a weapon of assassination

440
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,441
and call it deterrence.

441
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:30,212
You won't fool a fly or me.

442
00:42:31,915 --> 00:42:33,782
I'm not gonna drink it.

443
00:42:38,521 --> 00:42:40,822
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

444
00:42:40,824 --> 00:42:45,761
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

445
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:50,599
Because that should be upside-down.

446
00:42:52,735 --> 00:42:54,836
We know better now, don't we?

447
00:42:54,838 --> 00:42:57,973
The Devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

448
00:42:59,008 --> 00:43:01,109
No, they come from the sky.

449
00:44:57,393 --> 00:44:58,727
Oh.

450
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,562
I hope the next generation of Waynes

451
00:45:00,564 --> 00:45:04,466
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

452
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,602
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

453
00:45:08,871 --> 00:45:10,138
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

454
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,745
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

455
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:19,214
Two mentions of business
with the white Portuguese.

456
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,150
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

457
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:23,819
to the personal residence

458
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:25,487
of Alexander Luthor.

459
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:29,357
You think Lex Luthor
is the white Portuguese?

460
00:45:31,028 --> 00:45:33,361
I can't see that he needs the
income from imported arms.

461
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,397
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

462
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:36,732
and I'm gonna need the suit.

463
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,834
The bat interrogated six people

464
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,836
and came away with nothing.

465
00:45:42,672 --> 00:45:44,906
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

466
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:48,076
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

467
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,811
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

468
00:45:51,681 --> 00:45:53,081
He's been invited.

469
00:47:06,122 --> 00:47:08,490
Who's that?

470
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,926
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

471
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:13,695
That is Bruce Wayne.

472
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:15,931
<i>Philanthropist, bibliophile...</i>

473
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,134
True friend of the library of Metropolis.

474
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,535
Mr. Lex Luthor.

475
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:23,238
Me? Ah. Okay.

476
00:47:27,543 --> 00:47:30,111
Nicky. Uh...

477
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,347
<i>You're embarrassing me.
Um...</i>

478
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:34,382
<i>Speech, speech. Uh...</i>

479
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:36,017
<i>Blah, blah, blah. Uh...</i>

480
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,486
<i>Open bar.</i>

481
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:40,488
<i>The end.</i>

482
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,225
<i>Uh...</i>

483
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:46,228
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

484
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:47,829
Meaning a lover of humanity.

485
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,899
<i>Uh, it was coined about 2,500 years ago.</i>

486
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,667
All right.
Where am I going, Alfred?

487
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,836
Go past the elevator.

488
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:56,371
Do a left.

489
00:47:57,173 --> 00:47:59,541
<i>That's right, must be.</i>

490
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,877
<i>It's in the service corridor
in the basement.</i>

491
00:48:01,879 --> 00:48:03,345
<i>Go down the stairs.</i>

492
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,647
<i>Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.</i>

493
00:48:05,649 --> 00:48:08,383
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

494
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,385
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

495
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,221
<i>Hmm, that seems unfair.</i>

496
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:16,224
<i>Um... on a serious note,
the library of Metropolis...</i>

497
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:18,159
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

498
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:21,897
<i>But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.</i>

499
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,032
<i>My father could not afford
books growing up.</i>

500
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:27,034
<i>He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.</i>

501
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:30,255
All right. You got
the kitchens on your right.

502
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:32,540
<i>Do a left.</i>

503
00:48:32,542 --> 00:48:35,042
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

504
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,928
May I help you,
Mr. Wayne?

505
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,297
Uh, I just...

506
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:58,066
I thought the bathroom was
down here. I must have...

507
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:01,770
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

508
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,238
Men's room is upstairs.

509
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,839
Great. I'm okay.

510
00:49:05,775 --> 00:49:07,008
I like those shoes.

511
00:49:11,882 --> 00:49:13,782
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

512
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,250
<i>Go upstairs and socialize.</i>

513
00:49:15,252 --> 00:49:16,952
Some young lady from Metropolis

514
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,286
will make you honest.

515
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,324
In your dreams, Alfred.

516
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:23,825
<i>Books are knowledge,</i>

517
00:49:23,827 --> 00:49:27,395
and knowledge is power, and I am...

518
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:28,997
No. Uh, um...

519
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:32,000
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

520
00:49:34,136 --> 00:49:35,737
The bittersweet pain among men

521
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,607
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

522
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,544
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

523
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,982
Thank you for coming.

524
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:50,018
<i>Please drink. Drink.</i>

525
00:49:58,861 --> 00:50:03,164
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, <i>Daily Planet.</i>

526
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,266
Uh, my foundation has
already issued a statement

527
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:07,335
in support of books.

528
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:09,504
Sir?
Um...

529
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,207
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me.

530
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:13,875
All right?

531
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:16,845
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

532
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,547
<i>Daily Planet.</i> Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

533
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,151
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

534
00:50:23,153 --> 00:50:24,703
Good people are living in fear.

535
00:50:27,323 --> 00:50:29,491
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

536
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:32,861
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

537
00:50:35,998 --> 00:50:39,234
<i>The Daily Planet</i> criticizing those
who think they're above the law

538
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:43,405
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

539
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:46,174
Considering every time your
hero saves a cat out of a tree,

540
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:48,476
you write a puff piece editorial

541
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,212
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

542
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:53,982
could burn the whole place down.

543
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,818
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

544
00:50:58,854 --> 00:51:01,890
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

545
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,360
Maybe it's the Gotham city in me.

546
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,828
We just have a bad history

547
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,596
with freaks dressed like clowns.

548
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,100
<i>Boys! Um!</i>

549
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,702
Bruce Wayne meets
Clark Kent. Ha!

550
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:16,704
I love it. I love bringing
people together.

551
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:17,739
How are we?

552
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,507
Lex.
Hello. Good.

553
00:51:19,509 --> 00:51:22,010
Hi, hello, Lex,
it is a pleasure. Ow!

554
00:51:22,012 --> 00:51:23,611
Wow! That is a good grip!

555
00:51:23,613 --> 00:51:26,414
You should not pick a fight
with this person. Huh.

556
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,716
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

557
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:30,885
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

558
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:32,887
Well, you're welcome. You should
hop the Harbor more often, though.

559
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,222
I'd love to show you my labs.

560
00:51:34,224 --> 00:51:36,691
Maybe we could partner on something.

561
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:39,594
My R and D is up to all sorts of no good.

562
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:44,966
That's seven minutes.

563
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:46,718
<i>Looks like the transfer's complete.</i>

564
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:48,770
Mr. Luthor.
Yes?

565
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,605
The Governor.
Governor.

566
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,107
Excuse me.
Next time.

567
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,441
Governor! Hi!

568
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:55,143
Lex, it's good to see you.

569
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:34,482
Excuse me.

570
00:53:40,716 --> 00:53:43,218
<i>We, as a population on this planet,</i>

571
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,719
<i>have been looking for a savior.</i>

572
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,155
<i>90% of people believe in a higher power,</i>

573
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,590
<i>and every religion believes</i>

574
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,558
<i>in some sort of messianic figure.</i>

575
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,728
<i>And when this savior character
actually comes to earth,</i>

576
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:56,064
<i>we want to make him abide by our rules?</i>

577
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,199
<i>We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.</i>

578
00:53:58,201 --> 00:54:00,735
<i>We have to start thinking beyond politics.</i>

579
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,404
<i>Are there any moral
constraints on this person?</i>

580
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,406
<i>We have international law.</i>

581
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,576
<i>On this earth,
every act is a political act.</i>

582
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,411
<i>Is it really surprising</i>

583
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,780
<i>that the most powerful man in the world</i>

584
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,950
<i>should be a figure of controversy?</i>

585
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:18,519
<i>Uh, to have an individual engaging</i>

586
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,922
<i>in these state-level interventions</i>

587
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,057
<i>should give us all pause.</i>

588
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,293
<i>Human beings have a horrible track record</i>

589
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,562
<i>of following people with great power</i>

590
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,264
<i>down paths that led to</i>

591
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,266
<i>huge human atrocities.</i>

592
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,801
<i>We have always created
icons in our own image.</i>

593
00:54:33,803 --> 00:54:37,272
<i>What we've done is we
project ourselves onto him.</i>

594
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,975
<i>The fact is, maybe he's not some
sort of Devil or Jesus character.</i>

595
00:54:40,977 --> 00:54:43,444
<i>Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.</i>

596
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,614
Neil deGrasse Tyson: <i>We're talking
about a being whose very existence</i>

597
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:51,152
<i>challenges our own sense of
priority in the universe.</i>

598
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:52,620
<i>And you go back to copernicus,</i>

599
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:54,122
<i>where he restored the sun</i>

600
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,623
<i>in the center of the known universe,</i>

601
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,125
<i>displacing earth.</i>

602
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,960
<i>And you get to darwinian evolution,</i>

603
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,129
<i>and you find out we're not
special on this earth,</i>

604
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:03,965
<i>we're just one among other lifeforms.</i>

605
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,833
<i>And now we learn that we're not even</i>

606
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,302
<i>special in the entire universe</i>

607
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,171
<i>because there is Superman.</i>

608
00:55:10,173 --> 00:55:13,841
<i>There he is.
An alien among us.</i>

609
00:55:13,843 --> 00:55:15,943
<i>We're not alone.</i>

610
00:55:15,945 --> 00:55:18,146
<i>Are you, as a United States Senator,</i>

611
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:22,583
<i>personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,</i>

612
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:26,154
<i>"Superman could have saved your child,</i>

613
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:30,358
<i>"but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?</i>

614
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,327
<i>I'm not saying he shouldn't act.</i>

615
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:34,262
<i>I'm saying he shouldn't act unilaterally.</i>

616
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,497
<i>What are we talking about here, then?</i>

617
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,200
<i>Must there be a Superman?</i>

618
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,570
<i>There is.</i>

619
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:56,651
<i>Hello?</i>

620
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:58,019
<i>Mom?</i>

621
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,253
Clark!

622
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:01,656
What is it?

623
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:02,890
What's wrong?

624
00:56:02,892 --> 00:56:05,126
<i>No. Nothing. I just...</i>

625
00:56:08,063 --> 00:56:09,297
Hi.

626
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:12,767
Hi.

627
00:56:15,237 --> 00:56:17,105
How come Dad never left Kansas?

628
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:23,044
Well, he just...

629
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,546
You know how he was.

630
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,548
"What do I need to travel for?

631
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,117
"I'm already there."

632
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,121
Just wish it was more simple.

633
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:37,225
My baby boy.

634
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,462
Nothing was ever simple.

635
00:56:48,837 --> 00:56:50,438
An odd little duck.

636
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:53,908
<i>Hmm!</i>

637
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,610
I've never seen a metal like this.

638
00:56:57,212 --> 00:57:00,214
Could be Darpa Black Box.

639
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:01,883
Who could find out?

640
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:03,851
Nobody who'd want to.

641
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:06,721
Maybe they gave them out to the
rebels to test in theater.

642
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:09,924
Using live soldiers as Guinea pigs?

643
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:12,794
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

644
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:14,446
Stuff like this still shocks you.

645
00:57:36,785 --> 00:57:38,119
It don't come off!

646
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,221
It don't come off!

647
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,457
Prisoner transfer!

648
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,725
You can't put me in General, man.
They gonna kill me.

649
00:57:44,727 --> 00:57:46,327
Hey, you can't bring me to General.

650
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:47,628
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

651
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,397
for taking in your branded ass.

652
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:50,998
Sign here, please.
I'm marked, man.

653
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,633
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

654
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,168
He's only a criminal.

655
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:55,670
This way! Let's go!
They're gonna kill me!

656
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:56,971
<i>- They're gonna kill me!</i>
- Let's go!

657
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,072
Keefe.

658
00:57:58,074 --> 00:57:59,807
You made bail.

659
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,875
Open two.

660
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:07,849
Who paid?

661
00:58:19,828 --> 00:58:21,329
Who the hell are you?

662
00:58:26,835 --> 00:58:28,202
Just a man.

663
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,404
Yeah? Well, what the fuck
do you want?

664
00:58:35,477 --> 00:58:37,077
To help you stand for something.

665
00:58:41,984 --> 00:58:43,618
Your three o'clock's here.

666
00:58:53,562 --> 00:58:56,264
He made me half a man.

667
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,901
My wife

668
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,103
walked out on me.

669
00:59:04,139 --> 00:59:07,275
I can't even piss standing up.

670
00:59:08,377 --> 00:59:09,944
<i>Let me face him.</i>

671
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:13,414
You'll take care of it?

672
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:16,284
Good.

673
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:42,977
What?

674
01:00:01,530 --> 01:00:03,431
Wrong room, Miss.

675
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,899
Secretary Swanwick,

676
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,001
you haven't been returning my phone calls.

677
01:00:08,303 --> 01:00:10,438
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,

678
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,074
Major Farris is just outside that door.

679
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:14,976
You're treating me like a stranger?

680
01:00:16,545 --> 01:00:18,446
I'm treating you like a reporter.

681
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:22,216
All right. Is the us providing
experimental military arms

682
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,051
to rebels in Africa?

683
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,621
You know, with balls like yours,

684
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,556
you belong in here.

685
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:31,759
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

686
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,794
No, not tin.
But it's metal.

687
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,630
Fired in the Superman incident.

688
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:38,065
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.

689
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,300
We haven't been told the truth.

690
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,601
Here's the truth.

691
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:42,069
A reporter got greedy for a scoop

692
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,471
and went where she shouldn't have.

693
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,640
Superman acted like some rogue combatant

694
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,309
to rescue her, and people died.

695
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:51,045
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his Halo.

696
01:00:52,314 --> 01:00:53,481
Or yours.

697
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,983
- Major.
<i>- Sir.</i>

698
01:00:57,185 --> 01:00:58,619
<i>So.</i>

699
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:01,155
I logged into your dropbox to find copy.

700
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,524
There's copy all right.

701
01:01:03,526 --> 01:01:07,461
But nothing about football.
Nothing about, uh,

702
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,765
the friends of the Metropolis library,

703
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,668
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing

704
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,703
I told you not to pursue.

705
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:17,705
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

706
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:19,607
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

707
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:22,009
When the <i>Planet</i> was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

708
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,846
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

709
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:29,116
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

710
01:01:29,118 --> 01:01:32,119
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

711
01:01:34,690 --> 01:01:37,425
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

712
01:01:39,661 --> 01:01:41,462
<i>So apparently Superman</i>

713
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:43,831
<i>doesn't want us to think of
him as American anymore.</i>

714
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,232
<i>And really, why would we?</i>

715
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:47,168
<i>Aside from the red and blue costume.</i>

716
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:48,969
<i>And, I don't know, the fact that he has</i>

717
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,472
<i>one-third of the USA's
initials on his chest.</i>

718
01:01:51,474 --> 01:01:53,074
<i>I assume the only reason he's not wearing</i>

719
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,043
<i>the declaration of
independence as a cape is...</i>

720
01:01:56,045 --> 01:01:57,678
<i>He thinks it's too on-the-nose.</i>

721
01:01:57,680 --> 01:01:59,647
<i>What is going on back here?</i> No.

722
01:01:59,649 --> 01:02:01,182
Guys, come on.
Let's go.

723
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,650
<i>Get yourselves together and get out there.</i>

724
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,051
<i>Get those glasses on those trays.</i>

725
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:05,653
<i>We got thirsty people out there.</i>

726
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:15,896
I wonder, would you excuse us?

727
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:18,733
There's something I'd like to show you.
I'm sorry.

728
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,036
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

729
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:24,038
But I believe it's the action

730
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:28,909
perfectly in keeping with a king who
was also a psychopathic killer.

731
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:32,680
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

732
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,683
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

733
01:02:36,952 --> 01:02:39,019
It's the sword of Alexander.

734
01:02:40,422 --> 01:02:43,324
It's the blade that cut the Gordian Knot.

735
01:02:45,861 --> 01:02:47,228
It's a Triumph.

736
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,696
Yes.

737
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:50,097
<i>- Enjoy.
- Thank you.</i>

738
01:02:57,773 --> 01:02:59,473
It's a fake.

739
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:02,276
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

740
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:03,444
And now it hangs...

741
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,780
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

742
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:10,684
Excuse me.

743
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,721
Excuse me, Miss.

744
01:03:13,723 --> 01:03:16,957
The other night you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

745
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,126
Stealing's not polite.

746
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:21,796
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

747
01:03:23,632 --> 01:03:25,266
Who are you?

748
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,835
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

749
01:03:28,837 --> 01:03:30,771
Is that right?

750
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,841
I believe Mr. Luthor has a
photograph that belongs to me.

751
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,342
Did you get it?

752
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:37,845
As it happens, no, I didn't.

753
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,981
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

754
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:44,518
You know, I bet with that dress,

755
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,454
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

756
01:03:47,456 --> 01:03:48,956
But you're the 10th?

757
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,358
I'm guessing I'm the first

758
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,727
to see through that babe-in-the-woods act.

759
01:03:54,796 --> 01:03:56,463
You don't know me,

760
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,265
but I've known a few women like you.

761
01:04:01,603 --> 01:04:04,538
Oh, I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

762
01:04:06,208 --> 01:04:09,310
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

763
01:04:09,312 --> 01:04:12,079
Born with no natural inclination to share.

764
01:04:13,281 --> 01:04:15,516
I didn't steal your drive.

765
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,785
I borrowed it.

766
01:04:17,787 --> 01:04:20,754
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

767
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,090
Mr. Wayne.

768
01:06:16,338 --> 01:06:17,471
Did you get it?

769
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:18,806
The rock?

770
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,140
Yeah, we got it.

771
01:06:45,934 --> 01:06:47,034
I'm sorry.

772
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:51,705
Get down! Get down now!

773
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:08,622
No!

774
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:04,505
She was my world.

775
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:08,041
And you took her from me.

776
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,521
<i>Bruce!</i>

777
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:23,590
Bruce! Listen to me now!

778
01:09:26,861 --> 01:09:28,996
It's Lois!

779
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,931
It's Lois Lane!

780
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,200
<i>She's the key!</i>

781
01:09:35,003 --> 01:09:37,604
Am I too soon?

782
01:09:39,008 --> 01:09:41,508
I'm too soon!

783
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,844
<i>You're right about him!</i>

784
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,680
<i>You've always been right about him!</i>

785
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,049
Fear him! Fear him!

786
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:50,951
Find us, Bruce!

787
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,620
<i>You have to find us!</i>

788
01:10:57,919 --> 01:11:00,020
<i>The</i> white Portuguese <i>is not a man.</i>

789
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,121
<i>It's a ship.</i>

790
01:11:03,791 --> 01:11:07,027
Master Wayne, since the age of seven

791
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:09,096
you have been to the art of deception

792
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:11,698
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

793
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,469
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

794
01:11:17,405 --> 01:11:20,374
The <i>white Portuguese</i> is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

795
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:22,009
<i>What is it carrying?</i>

796
01:11:23,244 --> 01:11:24,544
It's a weapon.

797
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,114
It's a rock.

798
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,717
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

799
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:32,452
<i>The first sample big enough
to mean something</i>

800
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,488
turned up in the Indian ocean
three months ago.

801
01:11:34,490 --> 01:11:36,456
It is now aboard the <i>white Portuguese</i>

802
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:38,959
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

803
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,994
Who I am going to steal it from.

804
01:11:40,996 --> 01:11:42,929
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

805
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,197
To destroy it.

806
01:11:45,633 --> 01:11:46,700
No.

807
01:11:49,470 --> 01:11:51,905
You're gonna go to war?

808
01:11:51,907 --> 01:11:57,911
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

809
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:01,515
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

810
01:12:02,784 --> 01:12:05,619
What's next? Millions?

811
01:12:05,621 --> 01:12:08,288
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

812
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:10,857
and if we believe there's even a
1% chance that he is our enemy,

813
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:14,027
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

814
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,429
And we have to destroy him.

815
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:18,098
But he is not our enemy.

816
01:12:18,933 --> 01:12:20,967
Not today.

817
01:12:20,969 --> 01:12:23,670
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

818
01:12:23,672 --> 01:12:25,605
We've seen what promises are worth.

819
01:12:26,808 --> 01:12:28,442
How many good guys are left.

820
01:12:29,844 --> 01:12:31,511
How many stayed that way.

821
01:12:34,449 --> 01:12:35,949
14 hours.

822
01:12:38,519 --> 01:12:41,054
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

823
01:12:44,692 --> 01:12:49,029
I'm trying to find out what
happened to an inmate, a Santos.

824
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,731
I can't give out that information.

825
01:13:08,216 --> 01:13:09,549
Mommy!

826
01:13:13,488 --> 01:13:15,889
Mrs. Santos?

827
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:18,358
<i>May I ask you a few questions?</i>

828
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:20,160
He wasn't my husband.

829
01:13:20,162 --> 01:13:21,561
But I know what he did.

830
01:13:22,697 --> 01:13:24,865
But he was a father.

831
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:26,833
He was that, too.

832
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:28,435
They took him out of Gotham Central.

833
01:13:28,437 --> 01:13:30,670
They moved him to Metropolis.

834
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:32,572
But inside they know.

835
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:35,075
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

836
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,476
Bat's the judge.

837
01:13:37,545 --> 01:13:39,246
One man decides who lives.

838
01:13:39,248 --> 01:13:41,748
How is that justice?
Talk to me.

839
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,785
Help me change it.
With what? Your pen?

840
01:13:44,787 --> 01:13:47,721
A man like that, words don't stop him.

841
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:49,189
You know stops him?

842
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:51,124
A fist.

843
01:13:55,096 --> 01:13:56,496
<i>Kent, I want to talk to you.</i>

844
01:13:58,900 --> 01:14:00,434
Kent!

845
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:02,602
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

846
01:14:02,604 --> 01:14:04,604
I don't...
I don't know.

847
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:05,806
Clicks his heels three times,

848
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:07,507
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

849
01:14:09,410 --> 01:14:10,577
Son of a...

850
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:23,824
<i>Turn it!</i>

851
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:25,358
<i>Turn it!</i>

852
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:10,237
Move out!

853
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:47,307
Go, go, go, go!

854
01:16:26,347 --> 01:16:27,414
No!

855
01:17:52,466 --> 01:17:53,867
Where is he?

856
01:19:13,748 --> 01:19:16,449
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

857
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,284
don't go to it.

858
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:20,687
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

859
01:19:22,289 --> 01:19:23,590
Consider this mercy.

860
01:19:25,793 --> 01:19:27,193
<i>Tell me.</i>

861
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:33,133
<i>Do you bleed?</i>

862
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:43,109
<i>You will.</i>

863
01:21:25,379 --> 01:21:28,214
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

864
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:30,250
I went into the desert, people died.

865
01:21:30,252 --> 01:21:32,385
It keeps me awake.
It should.

866
01:21:38,192 --> 01:21:39,893
If you think that Superman is a murderer,

867
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,895
then throw it away.

868
01:21:41,897 --> 01:21:43,796
But I don't believe you think that.

869
01:21:46,867 --> 01:21:49,903
<i>How do we determine what's good?</i>

870
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,739
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

871
01:21:52,741 --> 01:21:55,608
<i>not a unilateral decision.</i>

872
01:21:55,610 --> 01:21:58,278
So I urge Superman to come

873
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:00,079
<i>to this hill of the people tomorrow</i>

874
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,782
<i>to see those who have suffered.</i>

875
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:06,052
<i>The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.</i>

876
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,554
<i>And to know what he stands for.</i>

877
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,757
<i>How far will he take his power?</i>

878
01:22:12,293 --> 01:22:16,162
<i>Does he act by our will or by his own?</i>

879
01:22:23,938 --> 01:22:26,839
<i>People hate what they don't understand.</i>

880
01:22:28,442 --> 01:22:32,111
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

881
01:22:33,614 --> 01:22:36,950
You're not a killer, a threat.

882
01:22:38,385 --> 01:22:40,687
I never wanted this world to have you.

883
01:22:44,125 --> 01:22:47,493
Be their hero, Clark.
Be their monument.

884
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,495
Be their angel.

885
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:51,364
Be anything they need you to be.

886
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:53,800
Or be none of it.

887
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:57,804
You don't owe this world a thing.

888
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:00,640
You never did.

889
01:23:03,077 --> 01:23:06,346
<i>This is Deniros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.</i>

890
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:07,814
<i>Please, mind your step.</i>

891
01:23:37,811 --> 01:23:40,113
<i>I have to speak to the Senator today.</i>

892
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:41,681
<i>You cannot see the Senator today.</i>

893
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,182
<i>I need to speak to her before the hearing.</i>

894
01:23:43,184 --> 01:23:45,118
<i>Do you understand how important this is?</i>

895
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,652
<i>I cannot let you see the Senator.</i>

896
01:23:46,654 --> 01:23:48,454
<i>Please, I need to speak to her.</i>

897
01:23:48,456 --> 01:23:51,357
<i>Please, Madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!</i>

898
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:52,859
<i>This is so important!</i>

899
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:55,395
<i>Come with me.
Don't touch me!</i>

900
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:57,597
Please! I'm sorry.
She wouldn't leave.

901
01:23:59,366 --> 01:24:02,168
I didn't tell you the truth.

902
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:05,071
C.I. Thinks
the desert was a setup.

903
01:24:05,073 --> 01:24:07,240
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

904
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:10,043
The bullet?

905
01:24:18,419 --> 01:24:19,886
The metal was developed
by a private company.

906
01:24:19,888 --> 01:24:21,187
What company?

907
01:24:21,189 --> 01:24:22,789
LexCorp.

908
01:24:23,891 --> 01:24:25,725
Lex Luthor?

909
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:28,877
He also had private security
contractors at the desert compound.

910
01:24:32,533 --> 01:24:34,033
Go on record.

911
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:37,737
Not a chance.
It's classified.

912
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:38,938
I happen to like my job.

913
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,706
It doesn't make sense.

914
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:42,775
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

915
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:45,277
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

916
01:24:51,718 --> 01:24:53,953
In the middle of the desert.
Thank you.

917
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:00,860
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

918
01:25:00,862 --> 01:25:03,096
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

919
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,597
will Superman show up?

920
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:05,598
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

921
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,899
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.

922
01:25:06,901 --> 01:25:08,434
Soledad o'Brien, <i>in the Moment.</i>

923
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:09,936
Quick question for you.

924
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,304
You're heading in
to meet with the Senators.

925
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,106
What will you tell them?

926
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:16,042
<i>I've come here to tell them to wake up.</i>

927
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:18,211
<i>This is flesh and blood.</i>

928
01:25:18,213 --> 01:25:19,645
<i>He has delivered a war here.</i>

929
01:25:19,647 --> 01:25:21,881
<i>And this...</i>

930
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,249
<i>This is what war looks like.</i>

931
01:25:23,251 --> 01:25:25,418
<i>I have nothing.</i>

932
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:27,787
<i>There are plenty of people, sir,
who would say he's their hero.</i>

933
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,455
<i>He is not a hero.</i>

934
01:25:29,457 --> 01:25:32,458
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

935
01:25:32,460 --> 01:25:34,660
Right now.

936
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:36,729
An anonymous source can verify everything

937
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:38,464
I told you about what happened in Nairomi.

938
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,100
An anonymous source?
<i>Run it.</i>

939
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,236
Luthor engineered the desert.

940
01:25:43,238 --> 01:25:45,404
It was an ambush for Superman.

941
01:25:45,406 --> 01:25:46,973
Trust your reporter.
Think Watergate.

942
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,108
<i>Yeah, and you need to think litigate.</i>

943
01:25:49,110 --> 01:25:51,644
<i>If you're wrong, Luthor will sue
the paper out of existence.</i>

944
01:25:51,646 --> 01:25:52,812
<i>You need proof.</i>

945
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:54,347
No. It needs to run now.

946
01:25:54,349 --> 01:25:56,015
<i>Before the hearing.</i>

947
01:25:56,017 --> 01:25:57,517
<i>If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.</i>

948
01:25:57,519 --> 01:25:59,785
I am not going to risk the paper

949
01:25:59,787 --> 01:26:01,487
so that you can pass notes in class

950
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,755
to the man that rescued you.

951
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,323
McGraw: <i>He paid her?</i>

952
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:07,126
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

953
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,529
Gave her a script to learn.

954
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,298
Her parents are alive back home.

955
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,300
But the girl's got a conscience.

956
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:17,302
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater. Senator!

957
01:26:17,938 --> 01:26:19,338
Hi, you.

958
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,706
Don't go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.

959
01:26:20,708 --> 01:26:22,708
Uh, you know what?
Mercy, you go in

960
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,877
and make sure no one takes my seat.

961
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:26,145
So what you been up to?

962
01:26:26,147 --> 01:26:27,947
I'm just here to tell my story.

963
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:29,482
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

964
01:26:29,484 --> 01:26:31,150
but a certain junior Senator from Kentucky

965
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:33,219
decided to block it.

966
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:36,856
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

967
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:39,525
Greg, why hasn't he been getting
our checks? He is, Mr. Wayne.

968
01:26:39,527 --> 01:26:42,195
He gets a check from
the victims fund every month.

969
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,697
He returns them.

970
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:46,232
<i>...who lost both his legs</i>

971
01:26:46,234 --> 01:26:48,701
<i>in those horrific events in Metropolis</i>

972
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:50,403
<i>that happened two years ago.</i>

973
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,604
Jesus.

974
01:26:53,674 --> 01:26:55,341
Why haven't I seen this?

975
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:57,376
<i>I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

976
01:26:57,378 --> 01:27:00,079
<i>And there he is.
Superman is here.</i>

977
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:02,348
<i>He is actually
at the United States Capitol.</i>

978
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,483
<i>This is really a historic moment.</i>

979
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,819
<i>Now we expect that Superman will give</i>

980
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:08,888
<i>some kind of a statement to the Senate,</i>

981
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,624
<i>to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.</i>

982
01:27:12,392 --> 01:27:13,893
He's here. He came.

983
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,395
He's above the Capitol.
Ah.

984
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:19,065
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, Junebug.

985
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,733
I grew up on a farm.

986
01:27:20,735 --> 01:27:23,202
I know how to wrestle a pig.

987
01:27:23,204 --> 01:27:25,504
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

988
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:28,307
It's that power can be innocent.

989
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:31,644
Good luck.

990
01:28:07,547 --> 01:28:09,715
Oh, Miss...

991
01:28:09,717 --> 01:28:11,517
Rudy, she's good to go.

992
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,060
Get out!

993
01:28:24,331 --> 01:28:27,166
Get out! Get out!
Superman! Superman!

994
01:28:34,274 --> 01:28:36,375
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

995
01:29:15,549 --> 01:29:18,484
Let me say at the outset that
I'm grateful to our witness

996
01:29:18,486 --> 01:29:21,354
for coming before us today.

997
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,123
This is how a democracy works.

998
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,859
We talk to each other.

999
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:32,365
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

1000
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,701
<i>I have sat here before to say
that shadow interventions</i>

1001
01:29:35,703 --> 01:29:38,704
<i>will not be tolerated by this committee.</i>

1002
01:29:38,706 --> 01:29:40,239
<i>Neither will lies.</i>

1003
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:45,311
Because today is a day for truth.

1004
01:29:47,147 --> 01:29:48,781
Because only by speaking...

1005
01:29:59,226 --> 01:30:03,396
Only by working together can we...

1006
01:30:09,503 --> 01:30:10,770
Can we...

1007
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:24,016
Can we create a free, and a...

1008
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:54,346
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1009
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,006
<i>We're back at the Nation's Capitol,</i>

1010
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:22,708

01:31:42,829 --> 01:31:45,164
Excuse me, officer.

1013
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:47,666
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

1014
01:31:55,609 --> 01:31:57,209
Breathe slowly and deeply.

1015
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:58,911
You're gonna be fine.

1016
01:32:06,520 --> 01:32:11,357
Thank you. I'm gonna need
a little room to work.

1017
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,827
<i>Ma'am, it appears you've
suffered a head injury.</i>

1018
01:32:14,829 --> 01:32:17,796

<i>They are still bringing victims out.</i>

1028

<i>Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast</i>

01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:07,533
<i>...could have gotten the explosive

1042
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:11,837
<i>As for Superman, he was in the room,</i>

<i>but obviously failed to stop him.</i>

1044

I didn't see it, lo.

1045
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:17,876
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1046
01:35:17,878 --> 01:35:19,545
Clark, there are people behind this.

1047

I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

All this time,

Thinking I'm here to do good.

1052
01:35:41,701 --> 01:35:44,103
Superman was never real.

1053
01:35:44,105 --> 01:35:46,805
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

1054

That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

01:44:40,807 --> 01:44:42,641
What do you mean?

1124
01:44:42,643 --> 01:44:45,277
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1125
01:44:47,780 --> 01:44:49,414
You couldn't stop it.

1126
01:44:49,416 --> 01:44:51,683
You couldn't see it.

1127
01:45:34,193 --> 01:45:35,593
Something, isn't it?

1128
01:45:37,463 --> 01:45:39,431
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,

1129
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:41,032
so we come to the mountains.

1130
01:45:42,535 --> 01:45:46,338
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1131
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,239
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1132
01:45:50,176 --> 01:45:53,211
I remember one season the water came bad.

1133
01:45:53,213 --> 01:45:55,146
I couldn't have been 12.

1134
01:45:55,148 --> 01:45:58,149
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1135
01:45:58,151 --> 01:46:00,318
We worked till, I think, I fainted.

1136
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,120
But we managed to stop the water.

1137
01:46:03,356 --> 01:46:06,391
We saved the farm.

1138
01:46:06,393 --> 01:46:09,594
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1139
01:46:12,031 --> 01:46:13,765
Later that day we found out

1140
01:46:15,034 --> 01:46:16,201
we blocked the water all right.

1141
01:46:16,203 --> 01:46:18,703
We sent it upstream.

1142
01:46:18,705 --> 01:46:22,240
The whole lang farm washed away.

1143
01:46:22,242 --> 01:46:25,243
<i>While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.</i>

1144
01:46:28,080 --> 01:46:30,882
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1145
01:46:34,253 --> 01:46:36,221
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1146
01:46:38,524 --> 01:46:39,891
Yeah.

1147
01:46:40,893 --> 01:46:42,827
When I met your mother.

1148
01:46:44,830 --> 01:46:47,665
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1149
01:46:50,069 --> 01:46:52,470
<i>She was my world.</i>

1150
01:46:55,074 --> 01:46:56,674
I miss you, son.

1151
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,648
I miss you too, Dad.

1152
01:47:23,436 --> 01:47:24,869
You know you can't win this.

1153
01:47:26,772 --> 01:47:28,373
It's suicide.

1154
01:47:31,110 --> 01:47:34,179
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1155
01:47:36,482 --> 01:47:40,285
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1156
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:44,222
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1157
01:47:44,224 --> 01:47:46,958
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1158
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:49,360
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1159
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:53,631
This is about the future of the world.

1160
01:47:55,401 --> 01:47:57,035
This is my legacy.

1161
01:47:58,270 --> 01:48:00,638
My father sat me down right here.

1162
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:02,807
Told me what Wayne manor was built on.

1163
01:48:02,809 --> 01:48:06,311
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1164
01:48:06,313 --> 01:48:09,981
The first generation made their
fortune trading with the French.

1165
01:48:09,983 --> 01:48:11,683
Pelts and skins.

1166
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,222
They were hunters.

1167
01:48:33,606 --> 01:48:37,375
So falls the house of Wayne.

1168
01:48:37,377 --> 01:48:39,177
<i>We gotta wait for more evidence,</i>

1169
01:48:39,179 --> 01:48:41,145
<i>but the question still remains,</i>

1170
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:43,014
<i>where is he?</i>

1171
01:48:43,016 --> 01:48:45,350
<i>If Superman was not involved,</i>

1172
01:48:45,352 --> 01:48:48,720
<i>if he's got nothing to hide,
then why hasn't he been seen</i>

1173
01:48:48,722 --> 01:48:50,655
<i>since the day of this tragedy?</i>

1174
01:48:50,657 --> 01:48:52,724
<i>You can't point a finger and...</i>

1175
01:48:52,726 --> 01:48:54,626
<i>I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

1176
01:48:54,628 --> 01:48:56,478
<i>If there is going to be a criminal...</i>

1177
01:50:25,050 --> 01:50:26,851
The night is here.

1178
01:50:57,483 --> 01:50:58,549
Excuse me.

1179
01:51:00,753 --> 01:51:01,986
Don't I know...

1180
01:52:05,084 --> 01:52:08,920
Plain lo in the morning.
Lola in slacks.

1181
01:52:10,156 --> 01:52:11,289
Lois Lane.

1182
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,526
Mmm. Come see the view.

1183
01:52:15,528 --> 01:52:16,728
Um...

1184
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:17,895
Mmm-mmm.

1185
01:52:17,897 --> 01:52:20,098
Now the secret to the height

1186
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:22,400
is the building material.

1187
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:25,903
It's light metals which sway
a bit in the wind.

1188
01:52:26,905 --> 01:52:27,972
Hmm.

1189
01:52:30,576 --> 01:52:33,911
And you know something about LexCorp
metals, don't you, Miss Lane?

1190
01:52:33,913 --> 01:52:35,780
I've proven what you've done.

1191
01:52:35,782 --> 01:52:37,882
Wow, you're feisty.

1192
01:52:37,884 --> 01:52:40,384
Unfortunately, that will blow away.

1193
01:52:40,386 --> 01:52:42,420
Like sand in the desert.

1194
01:52:42,422 --> 01:52:43,554
You're psychotic.

1195
01:52:43,556 --> 01:52:45,022
That is a three-syllable word

1196
01:52:45,024 --> 01:52:47,558
for any thought too big for little minds.

1197
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:50,361
Hmm. Next category: Circles.

1198
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:55,133
Round and round and round
they go to find Superman.

1199
01:52:55,135 --> 01:52:57,268
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1200
01:52:57,270 --> 01:52:58,870
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1201
01:52:58,872 --> 01:53:01,072
The shortest distance
between any two points

1202
01:53:01,074 --> 01:53:02,874
is a straight path.

1203
01:53:02,876 --> 01:53:05,810
And I believe the straightest
path to Superman

1204
01:53:05,812 --> 01:53:07,311
is a pretty little road...

1205
01:53:07,313 --> 01:53:09,747
Mmm.
Called Lois Lane.

1206
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:33,704
You came back.

1207
01:53:34,573 --> 01:53:35,907
You came back.

1208
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,361
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1209
01:54:01,935 --> 01:54:04,335
The problem of...
of evil in the world.

1210
01:54:04,337 --> 01:54:06,537
Uh, the problem of absolute virtue.

1211
01:54:06,539 --> 01:54:08,706
I'll take you in without breaking you.

1212
01:54:08,708 --> 01:54:10,508
Which is more than you deserve.

1213
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:12,977
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1214
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:14,679
You above all.

1215
01:54:14,681 --> 01:54:17,181
Ah, because that's what God is.

1216
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:21,252
Horus. Apollo.
Jehovah. Kal-El.

1217
01:54:22,187 --> 01:54:25,556
Clark Joseph Kent.

1218
01:54:27,326 --> 01:54:31,529
See, what we call God depends
upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1219
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:34,665
Because God is tribal.
God takes sides.

1220
01:54:34,667 --> 01:54:36,667
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1221
01:54:36,669 --> 01:54:39,704
to deliver me from Daddy's
fist and abominations. Mmm.

1222
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:43,507
I figured out way back,
if God is all-powerful,

1223
01:54:43,509 --> 01:54:44,942
he cannot be all-good.

1224
01:54:46,645 --> 01:54:48,212
And if he is all-good,

1225
01:54:48,214 --> 01:54:50,548
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1226
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,149
And neither can you be.

1227
01:54:53,352 --> 01:54:55,386
They need to see the fraud you are.

1228
01:54:55,988 --> 01:54:57,288
With their eyes.

1229
01:54:58,557 --> 01:55:01,425
The blood on your hands.

1230
01:55:01,427 --> 01:55:02,593
What have you done?

1231
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:04,495
Hmm. And tonight,
they will.

1232
01:55:04,497 --> 01:55:08,666
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

1233
01:55:08,668 --> 01:55:10,167
Across the bay.

1234
01:55:10,169 --> 01:55:12,737
Ripe fruit, his hate.
Two years growing.

1235
01:55:12,739 --> 01:55:14,772
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1236
01:55:14,774 --> 01:55:16,340
Little red notes, big bang.

1237
01:55:16,342 --> 01:55:19,076
You let your family die!

1238
01:55:19,078 --> 01:55:24,782
<i>And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.</i>

1239
01:55:24,784 --> 01:55:26,350
To the death.

1240
01:55:27,586 --> 01:55:30,621
Black and blue.
Fight night!

1241
01:55:30,623 --> 01:55:34,125
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1242
01:55:34,127 --> 01:55:36,961
God versus man.

1243
01:55:36,963 --> 01:55:39,864
Day versus night.

1244
01:55:39,866 --> 01:55:42,934
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1245
01:55:42,936 --> 01:55:45,202
You think I'll fight him for you?

1246
01:55:45,204 --> 01:55:47,972
Hmm, yes, I do. I think
you will fight-fight-fight

1247
01:55:47,974 --> 01:55:49,941
for that special lady in your life.

1248
01:55:49,943 --> 01:55:52,243
She's safe on the ground.
How about you?

1249
01:55:52,245 --> 01:55:55,880
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1250
01:55:55,882 --> 01:56:00,284
No. Every boy's special lady
is his mother.

1251
01:56:05,958 --> 01:56:08,459
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1252
01:56:08,961 --> 01:56:10,428
Hmm.

1253
01:56:10,430 --> 01:56:14,398
Why, the mother of a flying
demon must be a witch.

1254
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:17,268
The punishment for witches, what is that?

1255
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:19,403
That's right.
Death by fire.

1256
01:56:21,440 --> 01:56:23,007
Mmm.

1257
01:56:28,981 --> 01:56:31,015
Where is she?

1258
01:56:31,017 --> 01:56:32,817
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

1259
01:56:32,819 --> 01:56:35,319
Uh-uh-uh!
If you kill me, Martha dies.

1260
01:56:35,321 --> 01:56:37,488
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

1261
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:40,491
But if you kill the bat...

1262
01:56:40,493 --> 01:56:41,926
Martha lives.

1263
01:56:46,832 --> 01:56:50,101
There we go.
There we go. Hmm.

1264
01:56:52,671 --> 01:56:56,607
And now God bends to my will.

1265
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:05,182
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1266
01:57:05,184 --> 01:57:07,451
For the world to see
the holes in the Holy.

1267
01:57:07,453 --> 01:57:08,953
Yes, the almighty comes clean

1268
01:57:08,955 --> 01:57:10,321
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1269
01:57:10,323 --> 01:57:12,023
To save Martha,

1270
01:57:12,025 --> 01:57:13,691
bring me the head of the Bat.

1271
01:57:17,195 --> 01:57:18,496
Ah.

1272
01:57:18,498 --> 01:57:21,365
Mother of God, would you look at the time?

1273
01:57:21,367 --> 01:57:23,701
When you came here, you had an hour.

1274
01:57:24,970 --> 01:57:26,871
Now it's less.

1275
01:58:28,533 --> 01:58:30,234
<i>Brooke Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

1276
01:58:30,236 --> 01:58:32,470
<i>Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?</i>

1277
01:58:32,472 --> 01:58:34,472
There's something happening at the ship.

1278
01:58:35,440 --> 01:58:38,242
It's sending massive power surges.

1279
01:58:38,244 --> 01:58:40,077
<i>Police helicopters surrounding the area.</i>

1280
01:58:40,079 --> 01:58:42,813
<i>They've created a barricade
around this containment center.</i>

1281
01:58:42,815 --> 01:58:44,415
<i>And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here</i>

1282
01:58:44,417 --> 01:58:46,117
<i>to find out what's going on.</i>

1283
01:58:46,119 --> 01:58:48,119
<i>It is absolute chaos.
You can see that lightning,</i>

1284
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:49,787
<i>those surges of electricity.</i>

1285
01:58:49,789 --> 01:58:53,057
<i>They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.</i>

1286
01:58:53,059 --> 01:58:55,793
<i>Daily Planet.</i>

1287
01:58:55,795 --> 01:59:00,164
Lois. I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1288
01:59:00,166 --> 01:59:01,232
Who?

1289
01:59:03,602 --> 01:59:05,636
Or he has to die.

1290
01:59:05,638 --> 01:59:06,871
Clark.

1291
01:59:10,242 --> 01:59:12,409
No one stays good in this world.

1292
01:59:21,353 --> 01:59:25,356
<i>But as of right now, much of the
city remains in the dark tonight.</i>

1293
01:59:25,358 --> 01:59:29,693
<i>Much chaos. Much confusing happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.</i>

1294
01:59:29,695 --> 01:59:31,862
<i>Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.</i>

1295
01:59:31,864 --> 01:59:34,864
<i>I don't know if you can still
see those bolts of lightning...</i>

1296
02:01:36,254 --> 02:01:41,292
<i>2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.</i>

1297
02:01:41,294 --> 02:01:43,360
<i>All procedural interventions have failed.</i>

1298
02:01:44,229 --> 02:01:45,796
<i>Outcome</i>

1299
02:01:48,400 --> 02:01:49,667
<i>will be death.</i>

1300
02:01:58,343 --> 02:02:01,145
<i>Dr. Silas stone suspending
all clinical protocol.</i>

1301
02:02:01,147 --> 02:02:07,885
<i>US gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.</i>

1302
02:02:29,507 --> 02:02:30,808
<i>I need a chopper to Gotham.</i>

1303
02:02:30,810 --> 02:02:32,209
Call the heliport.

1304
02:02:32,211 --> 02:02:33,977
Chopper? We can
barely afford a bicycle.

1305
02:02:33,979 --> 02:02:35,145
You wanna chase a story?

1306
02:02:35,147 --> 02:02:36,447
Go to the ship.

1307
02:02:36,449 --> 02:02:37,815
Superman's probably there already.

1308
02:02:37,817 --> 02:02:40,584
Perry, it's not for a story.

1309
02:02:45,457 --> 02:02:47,157
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1310
02:02:47,159 --> 02:02:49,693
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the Goddamn roof.

1311
02:02:49,695 --> 02:02:51,195
On the roof, Lois!

1312
02:02:53,865 --> 02:02:55,532
Where are we headed?

1313
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:56,734
There!

1314
02:03:12,717 --> 02:03:15,753
<i>Well, here I am.</i>

1315
02:03:17,088 --> 02:03:18,455
Bruce. Please.

1316
02:03:20,225 --> 02:03:23,093
I was wrong.
You have to listen to me.

1317
02:03:23,095 --> 02:03:24,328
Lex wants us to...

1318
02:03:39,744 --> 02:03:42,079
You don't understand.

1319
02:03:42,081 --> 02:03:43,447
There's no time!

1320
02:03:45,083 --> 02:03:46,250
<i>I understand.</i>

1321
02:05:02,760 --> 02:05:04,328
Stay down!

1322
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:06,763
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

1323
02:05:44,836 --> 02:05:46,136
<i>Breathe it in.</i>

1324
02:05:48,907 --> 02:05:50,774
<i>That's fear.</i>

1325
02:05:53,678 --> 02:05:55,112
<i>You're not brave.</i>

1326
02:05:59,417 --> 02:06:00,951
<i>Men are brave.</i>

1327
02:09:50,715 --> 02:09:55,385
<i>I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.</i>

1328
02:09:55,387 --> 02:09:57,053
<i>That you're here for a reason.</i>

1329
02:09:58,556 --> 02:10:02,259
<i>My parents taught me a different lesson,</i>

1330
02:10:02,261 --> 02:10:04,728
<i>dying in the gutter</i>

1331
02:10:04,730 --> 02:10:06,730
<i>for no reason at all.</i>

1332
02:10:23,481 --> 02:10:26,149
<i>They taught me the world only makes sense</i>

1333
02:10:26,151 --> 02:10:28,218
<i>if you force it to.</i>

1334
02:11:06,557 --> 02:11:08,458
<i>You were never a God.</i>

1335
02:11:11,229 --> 02:11:13,396
<i>You were never even a man.</i>

1336
02:11:20,338 --> 02:11:23,707
You're letting him kill Martha.

1337
02:11:29,347 --> 02:11:31,147
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1338
02:11:32,350 --> 02:11:33,917
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1339
02:11:35,186 --> 02:11:37,754
Find him.

1340
02:11:38,990 --> 02:11:40,690
Save.

1341
02:11:40,692 --> 02:11:42,392
<i>Martha.</i>

1342
02:11:45,329 --> 02:11:46,730
<i>Martha.</i>

1343
02:12:17,528 --> 02:12:19,429
Martha.

1344
02:12:23,634 --> 02:12:24,934
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1345
02:12:26,738 --> 02:12:28,571
<i>Martha!
Why did you say that name?</i>

1346
02:12:28,573 --> 02:12:29,873
Clark! Stop!

1347
02:12:29,875 --> 02:12:31,241
Please! Stop!

1348
02:12:31,243 --> 02:12:32,909
<i>Why did you say that name?</i>

1349
02:12:32,911 --> 02:12:35,378
It's his mother's name!

1350
02:12:35,380 --> 02:12:37,647
It's his mother's name.

1351
02:13:09,247 --> 02:13:10,780
<i>We're not getting any answers.</i>

1352
02:13:10,782 --> 02:13:12,315
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1353
02:13:12,317 --> 02:13:13,516
A dangerous situation.

1354
02:13:13,518 --> 02:13:14,951
Military and police personnel

1355
02:13:14,953 --> 02:13:16,519
<i>surrounding the area.</i>

1356
02:13:32,036 --> 02:13:33,303
<i>Luthor.</i>

1357
02:13:33,305 --> 02:13:35,772
He wanted your life for hers.

1358
02:13:36,974 --> 02:13:38,808
She's losing time.

1359
02:13:38,810 --> 02:13:41,711
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1360
02:13:41,713 --> 02:13:43,279
It's got to be Lex.

1361
02:13:43,281 --> 02:13:46,016
<i>They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.</i>

1362
02:13:46,018 --> 02:13:48,118
My mother needs me.
<i>Wait.</i>

1363
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:51,654
<i>I'll make you a promise.</i>

1364
02:13:51,656 --> 02:13:53,923
<i>Martha won't die tonight.</i>

1365
02:14:20,651 --> 02:14:22,018
<i>Master Wayne.</i>

1366
02:14:22,020 --> 02:14:23,253
<i>Alfred.</i>

1367
02:14:23,255 --> 02:14:25,021
Uh, I'm sorry for listening in,

1368
02:14:25,023 --> 02:14:26,556
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

1369
02:14:26,558 --> 02:14:28,224
to a warehouse near the port.

1370
02:14:28,226 --> 02:14:29,759
<i>You're locked onto it.</i>

1371
02:14:29,761 --> 02:14:31,327
<i>I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

1372
02:14:31,329 --> 02:14:33,797
No, sir. You don't.

1373
02:14:54,552 --> 02:14:56,486
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1374
02:14:58,389 --> 02:15:02,592
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1375
02:15:15,739 --> 02:15:17,540
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1376
02:15:40,898 --> 02:15:42,298
<i>You have to take it, Alfred.</i>

1377
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:44,801
Ah, right.

1378
02:15:44,803 --> 02:15:46,870
Commencing drone mode.

1379
02:15:49,840 --> 02:15:51,674
Thermal imaging is showing me

1380
02:15:51,676 --> 02:15:54,277
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1381
02:15:54,279 --> 02:15:56,679
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

1382
02:19:01,765 --> 02:19:03,499
Drop it.

1383
02:19:05,169 --> 02:19:07,070
I said drop it!

1384
02:19:08,038 --> 02:19:09,372
I'll kill her.

1385
02:19:11,208 --> 02:19:13,443
Believe me, I'll do it.

1386
02:19:16,313 --> 02:19:17,447
<i>I believe you.</i>

1387
02:19:29,828 --> 02:19:32,862
<i>It's okay.
I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

1388
02:19:32,864 --> 02:19:35,765
I figured.
The cape.

1389
02:20:03,862 --> 02:20:05,395
"Late, late," says the white rabbit.

1390
02:20:05,397 --> 02:20:07,196
<i>40 seconds to animation.</i>

1391
02:20:07,198 --> 02:20:08,831
Right, wabbit?

1392
02:20:08,833 --> 02:20:12,602
Hmm. Out of tricks,
out of time.

1393
02:20:13,670 --> 02:20:16,172
And one Bat head short.

1394
02:20:16,174 --> 02:20:18,007
<i>30 seconds to animation.</i>

1395
02:20:18,009 --> 02:20:19,776
Ah. That'll be the cook.

1396
02:20:19,778 --> 02:20:20,943
Excuse me.

1397
02:20:20,945 --> 02:20:23,880
Uh, Gotham roast.
Well done.

1398
02:20:23,882 --> 02:20:26,048
Hello. Break the bad news.

1399
02:20:26,050 --> 02:20:28,951
<i>I'd rather do the breaking in person.</i>

1400
02:20:28,953 --> 02:20:30,686
<i>20 seconds to animation.</i>

1401
02:20:30,688 --> 02:20:31,754
You've lost.

1402
02:20:32,723 --> 02:20:33,956
I don't know how to lose.

1403
02:20:33,958 --> 02:20:35,124
You'll learn.

1404
02:20:35,126 --> 02:20:36,759
I'll learn.

1405
02:20:36,761 --> 02:20:39,262
I don't hate the sinner.

1406
02:20:39,264 --> 02:20:41,364
- I hate the sin.
<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>

1407
02:20:41,366 --> 02:20:44,033
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1408
02:20:44,868 --> 02:20:46,469
I cannot let you win.

1409
02:20:46,471 --> 02:20:47,737
I gave the bat a fighting chance to do it,

1410
02:20:47,739 --> 02:20:48,805
but he was not strong enough.

1411
02:20:48,807 --> 02:20:50,807
So, if man won't kill God...

1412
02:20:50,809 --> 02:20:52,975
<i>...two, one.</i>

1413
02:20:54,645 --> 02:20:55,845
...the Devil will do it!

1414
02:21:12,464 --> 02:21:13,896
Perry!

1415
02:21:13,898 --> 02:21:16,566
All right.
Stay calm, everybody!

1416
02:21:16,568 --> 02:21:18,000
<i>We're getting reports
there are total blackouts</i>

1417
02:21:18,002 --> 02:21:20,770
<i>in the north and to
the northwest of the city.</i>

1418
02:21:20,772 --> 02:21:22,171
<i>Federal authorities
are trying to determine</i>

1419
02:21:22,173 --> 02:21:24,474
<i>if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.</i>

1420
02:21:28,846 --> 02:21:31,948
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1421
02:21:31,950 --> 02:21:35,685
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1422
02:21:42,192 --> 02:21:44,360
Born to destroy you.

1423
02:21:47,097 --> 02:21:49,165
Your Doomsday.

1424
02:22:12,289 --> 02:22:15,091
Now God is good

1425
02:22:15,626 --> 02:22:17,093
as dead.

1426
02:22:20,298 --> 02:22:21,597
Oh!

1427
02:23:40,711 --> 02:23:42,111
Potus joining.

1428
02:23:42,113 --> 02:23:43,479
Mr. President.

1429
02:23:43,481 --> 02:23:45,147
<i>What the hell is it, Calvin?</i>

1430
02:23:45,149 --> 02:23:46,816
<i>These are live images from the top</i>

1431

<i>of the LexCorp tower

1432
02:23:49,053 --> 02:23:50,886
<i>Military aircraft are on the scene.</i>

1433
02:24:02,800 --> 02:24:04,767
Are you hurt, Ma'am?
I'm okay.

1434
02:24:04,769 --> 02:24:06,619
Good. You're gonna be
all right, okay?

1435
02:24:16,313 --> 02:24:19,181
<i>This thing emerged from
the Kryptonian crash site</i>

1436
02:24:19,183 --> 02:24:20,983
<i>just moments ago.</i>

1437
02:24:20,985 --> 02:24:22,985
<i>Thankfully though, the work day is over</i>

1438
02:24:22,987 --> 02:24:25,521
<i>in the downtown core.
It's nearly empty.</i>

1439
02:24:25,523 --> 02:24:29,258
<i>Now military aircraft.
Those are apache helicopters.</i>

1440
02:24:29,260 --> 02:24:31,761
<i>They have now just arrived.
The images that...</i>

1441
02:25:07,998 --> 02:25:11,200
<i>We've, uh... We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 news.</i>

1442
02:25:11,202 --> 02:25:13,536
<i>Now, it's not clear what just happened.</i>

1443
02:25:17,140 --> 02:25:18,708
<i>What's happening there, Alfred?</i>

1444
02:25:20,545 --> 02:25:22,511
How best to describe it?

1445
02:25:22,513 --> 02:25:24,413
<i>Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.</i>

1446
02:25:24,415 --> 02:25:25,981
Excuse me?

1447
02:25:25,983 --> 02:25:26,682
<i>We kindly ask that you stay in your seats.</i>

1448
02:25:26,684 --> 02:25:28,050
Excuse me?

1449
02:25:28,052 --> 02:25:29,452
Miss Prince?

1450
02:25:43,900 --> 02:25:45,901
Sir. Look,
they've cleared the city.

1451
02:25:45,903 --> 02:25:47,570
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1452
02:25:47,572 --> 02:25:49,405
We can go straight to key red,
Mr. President.

1453
02:25:49,407 --> 02:25:51,040
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1454
02:25:51,042 --> 02:25:52,341
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em

1455
02:25:52,343 --> 02:25:53,709
with no casualties, sir.

1456
02:25:53,711 --> 02:25:56,645
One casualty, Mr. President.
Superman.

1457
02:25:59,217 --> 02:26:00,583
<i>God have mercy on us all.</i>

1458
02:26:06,923 --> 02:26:08,958
Key is hot.
Key is hot.

1459
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,993
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1460
02:26:12,262 --> 02:26:13,562
<i>Fire at will.</i>

1461
02:26:13,564 --> 02:26:15,598
Three, two, one...

1462
02:27:04,614 --> 02:27:05,915
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1463
02:27:28,138 --> 02:27:29,505
Projectile 1. Impact.

1464
02:27:29,507 --> 02:27:31,540
Stryker's island, east of Metropolis.

1465
02:27:31,542 --> 02:27:32,842
That's uninhabited.

1466
02:27:32,844 --> 02:27:34,376
Projectile 2...

1467
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:42,151
No apparent reentry.

1468
02:27:42,153 --> 02:27:44,119
<i>Projectile 2?</i>

1469
02:27:44,121 --> 02:27:49,959
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1470
02:27:49,961 --> 02:27:51,260
Sir.

1471
02:27:51,962 --> 02:27:53,095
It's moving.

1472
02:28:34,537 --> 02:28:36,238
<i>The shockwaves are getting stronger.</i>

1473
02:28:36,240 --> 02:28:39,408
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1474
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:42,077
We can't attack.

1475
02:28:42,079 --> 02:28:44,546
<i>What are you saying, Calvin?</i>

1476
02:28:44,548 --> 02:28:46,782
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1477
02:29:14,277 --> 02:29:16,612
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1478
02:29:16,614 --> 02:29:17,780
<i>Alfred.</i>

1479
02:29:17,782 --> 02:29:19,615
<i>It's Kryptonian.</i>

1480
02:29:19,617 --> 02:29:22,318
<i>Only kryptonite weapons can kill it.</i>

1481
02:29:22,320 --> 02:29:25,487
They might.
If you had any left.

1482
02:29:25,489 --> 02:29:28,958
<i>I got one round left.</i>

1483
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:33,128
<i>The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure kryptonite.</i>

1484
02:29:33,130 --> 02:29:34,897
<i>It's back in Gotham.</i>

1485
02:29:34,899 --> 02:29:37,766
<i>If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.</i>

1486
02:29:37,768 --> 02:29:39,435
It would in theory.

1487
02:29:39,437 --> 02:29:41,937
<i>I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.</i>

1488
02:29:41,939 --> 02:29:43,672
<i>Back to the kryptonite.</i>

1489
02:30:44,334 --> 02:30:45,934
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

1490
02:31:35,352 --> 02:31:37,419
Why did you bring him back to the city?

1491
02:31:37,421 --> 02:31:38,921
<i>The port is abandoned.</i>

1492
02:31:38,923 --> 02:31:40,873
<i>There's a weapon here that can kill it.</i>

1493
02:31:53,369 --> 02:31:54,636
Did you find the spear?

1494
02:31:55,605 --> 02:31:57,372
<i>I've been a little busy.</i>

1495
02:31:57,374 --> 02:32:00,676
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1496
02:32:02,745 --> 02:32:05,647
This thing is from another world.

1497
02:32:06,316 --> 02:32:07,649
My world.

1498
02:32:07,651 --> 02:32:10,319
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1499
02:32:11,955 --> 02:32:13,155
Is she with you?

1500
02:32:14,124 --> 02:32:16,024
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

1501
02:35:54,477 --> 02:35:56,011
Clark!

1502
02:35:56,013 --> 02:35:57,379
Clark!

1503
02:36:04,854 --> 02:36:05,921
Clark!

1504
02:36:16,400 --> 02:36:18,300
Clark!

1505
02:36:18,302 --> 02:36:19,935
Clark! Are you all right?

1506
02:36:57,740 --> 02:36:59,474
I love you.

1507
02:37:03,079 --> 02:37:06,515
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1508
02:37:08,251 --> 02:37:10,185
This is my world.

1509
02:37:10,187 --> 02:37:11,653
No, Clark, don't.

1510
02:37:15,258 --> 02:37:17,626
You are my world.

1511
02:37:17,628 --> 02:37:18,760
No.

1512
02:37:21,931 --> 02:37:23,665
Please. Clark!

1513
02:44:29,625 --> 02:44:30,692
Hi.

1514
02:44:37,700 --> 02:44:40,435
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1515
02:47:07,516 --> 02:47:09,684
"The dead shall live.

1516
02:47:10,519 --> 02:47:13,755
"My slain shall rise again.

1517
02:47:16,725 --> 02:47:19,594
"Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1518
02:47:21,030 --> 02:47:24,365
"For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

1519
02:47:26,201 --> 02:47:31,139
"And the earth shall
give birth to her dead."

1520
02:47:38,547 --> 02:47:41,215
Ah, I need a ride back to the house.

1521
02:47:41,217 --> 02:47:43,918
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1522
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:46,054
They said it's all taken care of.

1523
02:47:46,056 --> 02:47:47,121
By whom?

1524
02:47:48,057 --> 02:47:49,791
Anonymous donor.

1525
02:48:33,602 --> 02:48:37,772
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1526
02:48:37,774 --> 02:48:39,841
They don't know how to honor him,

1527
02:48:40,876 --> 02:48:42,677
except as a soldier.

1528
02:48:44,446 --> 02:48:47,782
I've failed him in life.

1529
02:48:49,251 --> 02:48:53,054
I won't fail him in death.

1530
02:48:53,056 --> 02:48:55,723
Help me find the others like you.

1531
02:48:55,725 --> 02:48:57,658
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1532
02:48:58,594 --> 02:49:01,395
They will.
And they'll fight.

1533
02:49:02,598 --> 02:49:04,565
We have to stand together.

1534
02:49:12,307 --> 02:49:15,543
100 years ago, I walked away from mankind.

1535
02:49:17,613 --> 02:49:19,580
From a century of horrors.

1536
02:49:23,152 --> 02:49:26,854
Man made a world where standing
together is impossible.

1537
02:49:29,925 --> 02:49:31,859
Men are still good.

1538
02:49:34,329 --> 02:49:37,231
<i>We fight. We kill.</i>

1539
02:49:38,433 --> 02:49:40,835
<i>We betray one another.</i>

1540
02:49:42,704 --> 02:49:44,772
<i>But we can rebuild.</i>

1541
02:49:46,008 --> 02:49:47,875
<i>We can do better.</i>

1542
02:49:49,144 --> 02:49:51,179
<i>We will.</i>

1543
02:49:51,181 --> 02:49:52,380
<i>We have to.</i>

1544
02:50:15,470 --> 02:50:17,038
The others like me.

1545
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:19,307
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1546
02:50:24,713 --> 02:50:26,948
Just a feeling.

1547
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:40,761
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1548
02:50:40,763 --> 02:50:43,513
The Warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1549
02:50:45,100 --> 02:50:47,001
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1550
02:50:47,003 --> 02:50:49,804
The Warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1551
02:50:57,679 --> 02:50:59,580
Turn around and face the wall.

1552
02:51:01,617 --> 02:51:04,018
Place your forehead against the wall.

1553
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:05,920
Put your hands behind your back,

1554
02:51:05,922 --> 02:51:07,989
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1555
02:51:36,285 --> 02:51:39,220
<i>Whatever you do, wherever you go,</i>

1556
02:51:39,222 --> 02:51:41,322
<i>I'll be watching you.</i>

1557
02:51:41,957 --> 02:51:43,357
Oh...

1558
02:51:44,793 --> 02:51:46,360
Look at us.

1559
02:51:47,462 --> 02:51:49,764
This is how it all caves in.

1560
02:51:49,766 --> 02:51:55,169
Civilization on the Wayne
manor's out the window.

1561
02:51:55,171 --> 02:51:56,737
Mmm?

1562
02:51:59,242 --> 02:52:02,143
But who would believe me?
I...

1563
02:52:02,145 --> 02:52:04,578
I'm insane.

1564
02:52:05,847 --> 02:52:08,015
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1565
02:52:08,017 --> 02:52:09,950
That's right.

1566
02:52:09,952 --> 02:52:13,788
We have hospitals that treat the
mentally ill with compassion.

1567
02:52:15,091 --> 02:52:17,091
But that's not where you're going.

1568
02:52:17,093 --> 02:52:20,594
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1569
02:52:21,997 --> 02:52:24,532
I still have some friends there.

1570
02:52:24,534 --> 02:52:26,167
They're expecting you.

1571
02:52:30,672 --> 02:52:34,909
But the bell's already been rung.

1572
02:52:37,379 --> 02:52:38,846
And they've heard it.

1573
02:52:40,682 --> 02:52:42,450
Out in the dark.

1574
02:52:42,452 --> 02:52:45,119
Among the stars. Hmm.

1575
02:52:48,190 --> 02:52:51,759
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1576
02:53:01,136 --> 02:53:03,938
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1577
02:53:05,240 --> 02:53:08,776
He's hungry.
He's found us.

1578
02:53:09,978 --> 02:53:11,746
And he's coming!

1579
02:53:14,883 --> 02:53:17,483
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1580
02:53:19,654 --> 02:53:22,623
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1581
02:53:24,493 --> 02:53:27,795
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1582
02:53:29,097 --> 02:53:32,133
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1583
02:53:34,169 --> 02:53:38,939
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1584
02:53:38,941 --> 02:53:42,109
<i>Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>
