1
00:01:13,798 --> 00:01:16,848
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,108 --> 00:01:20,438
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:32,167
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,847
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:35,427 --> 00:01:38,418
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:40,557
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,968
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,168 --> 00:01:46,955
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:48,328
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,927
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

11
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:12,888
Shame.

12
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,557
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:20,788
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,828
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:28,198
True.

16
00:02:29,078 --> 00:02:30,437
How did he die?

17
00:02:30,647 --> 00:02:32,108
Your contact?

18
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:33,818
Not well.

19
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,758
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:25,997
Well...

21
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:28,427
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,557
The second is...

23
00:03:34,538 --> 00:03:36,377
Yes.

24
00:03:36,747 --> 00:03:39,237
Considerably.

25
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:36,447
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:39,218
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:41,648
That's all my organization will guarantee.

28
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:24,728
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:24,927 --> 00:08:27,315
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

30
00:08:27,398 --> 00:08:30,098
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:34,878 --> 00:08:37,177
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:37,378 --> 00:08:39,008
No.

33
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:41,878
I believe in a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:42,087 --> 00:08:44,347
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:45,817
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:48,035
And I can access it anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:48,118 --> 00:08:49,217
Yes.

38
00:09:07,778 --> 00:09:10,408
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

39
00:09:10,607 --> 00:09:12,268
...of Skyfleet stock.

40
00:09:12,477 --> 00:09:16,347
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

41
00:09:16,548 --> 00:09:19,717
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:22,618
Just do it.

43
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,857
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:02,427 --> 00:10:05,227
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:21,317
He's on the move.

46
00:10:21,947 --> 00:10:24,447
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:27,307
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:29,577
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

49
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:38,617
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

50
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:12,824
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:12,907 --> 00:20:14,307
...my dear general.

52
00:20:15,278 --> 00:20:16,538
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,178
All in.

54
00:20:26,087 --> 00:20:29,107
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:29,327 --> 00:20:31,417
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:00,188
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:03,548
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

58
00:21:03,758 --> 00:21:06,488
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:08,228 --> 00:21:10,428
Give our guests five minutes to leave...

60
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:12,928
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:26,278
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:26,448 --> 00:21:29,064
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

63
00:21:29,147 --> 00:21:30,465
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:34,248
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:37,474
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:40,117
And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:40,327 --> 00:21:43,314
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:45,798
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,655
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

70
00:21:48,738 --> 00:21:50,484
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

71
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:52,397
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,018 --> 00:23:10,678
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,377
Sorry.

74
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:14,487
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:14,587 --> 00:23:16,248
Or yourself.

76
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:18,478
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,218
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:21,428 --> 00:23:23,128
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,167
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:25,367 --> 00:23:27,367
We wanted to question him, not kill him.

81
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,584
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:31,667 --> 00:23:32,728
I did.

83
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:36,064
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

84
00:23:36,147 --> 00:23:37,938
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:38,478 --> 00:23:42,095
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:42,178 --> 00:23:43,804
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:43,887 --> 00:23:46,008
Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?

88
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:49,448
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:49,657 --> 00:23:51,488
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:51,688 --> 00:23:54,557
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

91
00:23:54,758 --> 00:23:57,108
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:57,298 --> 00:23:59,014
The same way I found out your name.

93
00:23:59,097 --> 00:24:02,155
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

94
00:24:02,238 --> 00:24:04,708
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:08,897
I knew it was too early to promote you.

96
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:13,377
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,778
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:22,018 --> 00:24:26,928
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:30,498
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:31,127 --> 00:24:33,827
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

101
00:24:34,038 --> 00:24:35,897
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,557
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

103
00:24:38,708 --> 00:24:41,228
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

104
00:24:42,107 --> 00:24:45,208
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:50,038
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:50,248 --> 00:24:52,405
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:52,488 --> 00:24:53,974
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:56,958
Because these bastards want your head.

109
00:24:57,157 --> 00:25:00,617
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

110
00:25:07,968 --> 00:25:09,958
And Bond...

111
00:25:13,377 --> 00:25:15,968
...don't ever break into
my house again.

112
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,847
Ma'am.

113
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:34,387
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:39,397 --> 00:26:41,627
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:55,438
Hello.

116
00:26:55,637 --> 00:26:57,768
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

117
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:01,278
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:44,688 --> 00:27:47,627
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

119
00:27:47,827 --> 00:27:49,528
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:28,627 --> 00:29:31,117
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

121
00:29:31,327 --> 00:29:34,885
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:34,968 --> 00:29:36,367
Okay.

123
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:41,238
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

124
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:46,678
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

125
00:29:46,817 --> 00:29:50,768
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:50,988 --> 00:29:53,205
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

127
00:29:53,288 --> 00:29:55,718
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

128
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:58,774
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:58,857 --> 00:30:00,707
Isn't the type to take bad news well.

130
00:30:01,428 --> 00:30:04,397
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,657
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:09,298 --> 00:30:10,597
Thank you.

133
00:31:11,698 --> 00:31:14,397
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:14,597 --> 00:31:17,038
You woke me to share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:19,324
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

136
00:31:19,407 --> 00:31:21,468
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:24,538
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

138
00:31:24,748 --> 00:31:27,107
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

139
00:31:27,317 --> 00:31:31,178
- Who's he looking at?
- Alex Dimitrios.

140
00:31:31,587 --> 00:31:33,208
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:43,798 --> 00:31:45,698
Now known associates...

142
00:31:57,407 --> 00:31:58,847
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:15,258 --> 00:32:17,928
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:20,597
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,148
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:23,907 --> 00:32:25,984
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:27,298
Yeah.

148
00:32:35,178 --> 00:32:36,264
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:36,347 --> 00:32:38,697
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

150
00:32:50,228 --> 00:32:52,167
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,028
I'm in.

152
00:32:56,438 --> 00:32:58,127
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:03,567
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

154
00:33:05,178 --> 00:33:07,407
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:13,548
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,248
I heard you.

157
00:33:15,887 --> 00:33:17,647
Five to call.

158
00:33:21,258 --> 00:33:22,675
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:22,758 --> 00:33:24,127
Ace high.

160
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:27,268
Check or bet.

161
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:28,958
- Check.
- And to you.

162
00:33:29,167 --> 00:33:31,107
Five thousand.

163
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:36,508
Five to call.

164
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:50,718
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:52,528 --> 00:33:53,718
All in.

166
00:33:54,397 --> 00:33:56,188
No, wait.

167
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:58,067
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:58,397 --> 00:34:00,798
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:07,397
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:09,078 --> 00:34:10,937
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:11,147 --> 00:34:14,138
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

172
00:34:24,357 --> 00:34:26,087
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:31,098 --> 00:34:32,528
Three kings.

174
00:34:38,707 --> 00:34:40,468
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,067
Trip aces.

176
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:44,368
Aces win.

177
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,408
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,187
Thank you.

179
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:56,857
Sir.

180
00:35:29,017 --> 00:35:31,357
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:32,388 --> 00:35:35,558
No wonder he was in such a foul mood.

182
00:35:36,798 --> 00:35:37,988
My mistake.

183
00:35:38,198 --> 00:35:39,548
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:43,497
That would really send him over the edge.

185
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:45,638
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:45,937 --> 00:35:48,037
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.

187
00:35:55,718 --> 00:35:57,008
Perhaps.

188
00:35:57,218 --> 00:35:59,068
Well, what about a drink at my place?

189
00:35:59,848 --> 00:36:01,848
Your place?

190
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:05,118
- Is it close?
- Very.

191
00:36:11,528 --> 00:36:13,397
One drink.

192
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:40,445
Good evening, sir, and welcome back.

193
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:42,428
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:54,678 --> 00:36:57,738
I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

195
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:00,607
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:00,817 --> 00:37:05,308
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:07,118 --> 00:37:09,587
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:09,888 --> 00:37:12,357
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:12,558 --> 00:37:14,528
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:15,497 --> 00:37:17,727
I have someone else willing to do the job.

201
00:37:17,928 --> 00:37:19,727
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:20,567 --> 00:37:22,328
...and payment.

203
00:37:33,348 --> 00:37:36,937
You like married women, don't you, James?

204
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,348
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:45,087
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:48,258
You, my husband...

207
00:37:48,457 --> 00:37:51,127
I had so many chances to be happy...

208
00:37:51,328 --> 00:37:53,698
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:53,897 --> 00:37:56,598
Why can't nice guys be more like you?

210
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,037
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:37:59,968 --> 00:38:02,238
Yes.

212
00:38:04,977 --> 00:38:07,808
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:14,687
What makes your husband a bad man?

214
00:38:14,888 --> 00:38:17,448
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:17,658 --> 00:38:19,317
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:19,528 --> 00:38:23,187
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:29,167
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

218
00:38:29,368 --> 00:38:31,837
How afraid?

219
00:38:32,408 --> 00:38:35,207
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,948
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:50,278
Now would seem an appropriate time.

222
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,857
Does "ellipsis" mean anything to you?

223
00:39:02,198 --> 00:39:04,167
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:04,368 --> 00:39:06,698
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,837
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:11,037
I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami.

227
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:13,767
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.

228
00:39:13,977 --> 00:39:16,308
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:16,517 --> 00:39:19,278
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:25,227
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:25,428 --> 00:39:29,587
...so you have all night
to question me.

232
00:39:32,428 --> 00:39:33,897
In that case...

233
00:39:34,098 --> 00:39:35,227
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:35,437 --> 00:39:37,798
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:43,707 --> 00:39:45,107
Good evening. Room Service.

236
00:39:45,308 --> 00:39:49,107
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:50,567
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:50,747 --> 00:39:53,218
- With everything?
- Yes, with everything.

239
00:39:53,417 --> 00:39:55,508
- And would that be for two, sir?
- What?

240
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:58,988
- For two?
- No, for one.

241
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:33,817
Wait here.

242
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:41,058
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:45,037 --> 00:40:47,408
Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...

244
00:40:47,607 --> 00:40:50,437
...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...

245
00:40:50,647 --> 00:40:52,408
...nervous and vascular systems.

246
00:41:53,008 --> 00:41:56,408
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

247
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:01,308
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

248
00:42:01,517 --> 00:42:02,678
This is edutainment.

249
00:42:29,037 --> 00:42:31,198
...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...

250
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:35,278
...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

251
00:42:49,428 --> 00:42:50,948
Hello.

252
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:53,067
Hello.

253
00:43:02,738 --> 00:43:05,238
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

254
00:43:05,448 --> 00:43:08,008
Welcome to Miami International Airport.

255
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:11,337
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted...

256
00:44:46,348 --> 00:44:49,337
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:49,548 --> 00:44:52,298
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

258
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:55,874
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:55,957 --> 00:44:58,707
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

260
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:01,658
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

261
00:45:06,098 --> 00:45:08,828
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:12,667
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:35,457 --> 00:45:37,798
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

264
00:45:37,997 --> 00:45:41,747
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:22,638 --> 00:46:23,667
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:23,877 --> 00:46:25,468
Bond? Bond!

267
00:46:28,477 --> 00:46:30,578
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,718
It's launching today.

269
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:36,917
I gotta go.

270
00:51:02,258 --> 00:51:03,988
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:06,747 --> 00:52:08,747
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:41,747 --> 00:53:46,517
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:46,718 --> 00:53:52,118
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:58,667 --> 00:54:00,828
Someone talked.

275
00:54:24,658 --> 00:54:26,675
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:26,758 --> 00:54:28,817
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

277
00:54:43,207 --> 00:54:46,238
Quite the body count you're stacking up.

278
00:54:47,048 --> 00:54:49,894
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:49,977 --> 00:54:52,607
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

280
00:54:53,317 --> 00:54:55,535
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

281
00:54:55,618 --> 00:54:56,618
No.

282
00:54:56,787 --> 00:55:00,247
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

283
00:55:00,457 --> 00:55:02,015
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,975
Knew where to put his hands on weapons...

285
00:55:04,058 --> 00:55:05,615
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:05,698 --> 00:55:07,445
He worked with anyone who had money.

287
00:55:07,528 --> 00:55:10,897
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:13,124
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:13,207 --> 00:55:16,667
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:16,877 --> 00:55:18,638
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,408
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

292
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:26,178
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:56,937
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:58,287 --> 00:55:59,778
Yes.

295
00:56:04,687 --> 00:56:07,817
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9.11...

296
00:56:08,028 --> 00:56:11,328
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:15,357
When the stocks hit bottom on 9I12,
somebody made a fortune.

298
00:56:16,067 --> 00:56:18,754
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:18,837 --> 00:56:20,067
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:20,267 --> 00:56:24,037
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:24,238 --> 00:56:28,267
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:29,278 --> 00:56:31,178
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,434
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:36,218
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:40,477
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:40,687 --> 00:56:43,457
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

307
00:56:43,658 --> 00:56:46,218
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:46,428 --> 00:56:48,515
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

309
00:56:48,598 --> 00:56:52,868
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:56,468
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

311
00:56:56,678 --> 00:56:59,624
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

312
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,195
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:01,278 --> 00:57:03,508
If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:03,718 --> 00:57:06,618
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:06,747 --> 00:57:08,477
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:11,348
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:11,558 --> 00:57:15,118
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:15,528 --> 00:57:17,357
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:21,997 --> 00:57:26,337
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

320
00:57:26,537 --> 00:57:29,698
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:30,408 --> 00:57:32,238
No.

322
00:57:34,308 --> 00:57:36,058
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:37,178 --> 00:57:38,477
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:38,687 --> 00:57:40,048
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:43,167
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

326
00:57:44,118 --> 00:57:46,417
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:04,977 --> 00:58:06,667
Thank you.

328
00:58:13,687 --> 00:58:15,048
I'm the money.

329
00:58:17,357 --> 00:58:18,618
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:21,058 --> 00:58:23,458
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

331
00:58:24,528 --> 00:58:26,187
"Vesper."

332
00:58:26,397 --> 00:58:28,947
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

333
00:58:29,667 --> 00:58:31,098
Thank you.

334
00:58:31,308 --> 00:58:32,968
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:35,667
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:37,837
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:39,948 --> 00:58:41,377
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:44,228
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:44,317 --> 00:58:48,647
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:48,857 --> 00:58:52,004
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:52,087 --> 00:58:54,988
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:58,368 --> 00:58:59,758
What looks good?

343
00:59:07,008 --> 00:59:09,908
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

344
00:59:10,008 --> 00:59:12,095
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

345
00:59:12,178 --> 00:59:15,128
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

346
00:59:15,377 --> 00:59:17,477
So that would be what you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,147
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:22,357 --> 00:59:24,975
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

349
00:59:25,058 --> 00:59:26,544
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:26,627 --> 00:59:29,027
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

351
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,015
Which is why I've been able to detect...

352
00:59:31,098 --> 00:59:33,248
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:33,928 --> 00:59:36,798
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

354
00:59:37,868 --> 00:59:40,184
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:40,267 --> 00:59:41,758
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:41,977 --> 00:59:44,664
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:46,977
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

358
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:49,207
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

359
00:59:49,417 --> 00:59:51,578
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:51,787 --> 00:59:53,377
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:53,848 --> 00:59:55,848
You worry you won't be taken seriously.

362
00:59:56,058 --> 00:59:59,048
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

363
00:59:59,258 --> 01:00:00,945
True, but this one overcompensates...

364
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:02,975
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:05,544
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

366
01:00:05,627 --> 01:00:08,098
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

367
01:00:08,298 --> 01:00:11,754
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:11,837 --> 01:00:14,028
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

369
01:00:14,238 --> 01:00:17,008
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

370
01:00:17,508 --> 01:00:21,537
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

371
01:00:21,747 --> 01:00:24,965
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

372
01:00:25,048 --> 01:00:27,707
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:30,687 --> 01:00:32,618
All right.

374
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:36,175
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:38,745
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

376
01:00:38,828 --> 01:00:40,727
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,954
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

378
01:00:43,037 --> 01:00:45,598
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

379
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,854
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

380
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:50,925
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:51,008 --> 01:00:53,624
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

382
01:00:53,707 --> 01:00:55,698
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:00:59,647 --> 01:01:01,638
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:02,118 --> 01:01:03,948
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:04,158 --> 01:01:05,917
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:06,127 --> 01:01:08,528
...since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:08,727 --> 01:01:11,115
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

388
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:13,388
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

389
01:01:13,598 --> 01:01:14,687
You know...

390
01:01:14,897 --> 01:01:18,837
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

391
01:01:19,337 --> 01:01:21,707
- Rolex?
- Omega.

392
01:01:21,908 --> 01:01:23,738
Beautiful.

393
01:01:24,238 --> 01:01:25,908
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:26,107 --> 01:01:29,064
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:30,508
No, of course not.

396
01:01:30,718 --> 01:01:32,535
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine.

397
01:01:32,618 --> 01:01:34,818
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:34,988 --> 01:01:37,078
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:38,558 --> 01:01:40,687
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

400
01:01:40,888 --> 01:01:43,445
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

401
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:45,497
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,488
You noticed?

403
01:01:47,698 --> 01:01:49,687
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:49,897 --> 01:01:51,227
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:51,638 --> 01:01:53,198
Skewered.

406
01:01:53,408 --> 01:01:55,028
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:56,877 --> 01:01:58,368
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:58,578 --> 01:02:00,908
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:19,397
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

410
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,897
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

411
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:40,218
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:43,667
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:44,388 --> 01:02:47,475
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:47,558 --> 01:02:50,258
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:50,658 --> 01:02:53,627
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

416
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:55,515
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

417
01:02:55,598 --> 01:02:57,914
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:57,997 --> 01:02:59,968
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:00,167 --> 01:03:02,167
We've been involved for quite a while...

420
01:03:02,667 --> 01:03:04,428
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:04,638 --> 01:03:07,008
But my family is strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:07,207 --> 01:03:10,055
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:10,138 --> 01:03:13,408
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

424
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:16,107
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:16,317 --> 01:03:18,405
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

426
01:03:18,488 --> 01:03:21,247
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:21,488 --> 01:03:22,578
Smart?

428
01:03:23,187 --> 01:03:24,888
Single.

429
01:03:44,107 --> 01:03:46,225
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

430
01:03:46,308 --> 01:03:49,178
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:49,377 --> 01:03:52,107
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:52,747 --> 01:03:55,087
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:03:59,428 --> 01:04:02,087
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:03,888
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:08,058
Very funny.

436
01:04:08,267 --> 01:04:10,354
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

437
01:04:10,437 --> 01:04:12,624
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

438
01:04:12,707 --> 01:04:14,937
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

439
01:04:15,138 --> 01:04:17,624
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

440
01:04:17,707 --> 01:04:20,124
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

441
01:04:20,207 --> 01:04:22,738
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

442
01:04:23,048 --> 01:04:24,805
And now he knows something about you.

443
01:04:24,888 --> 01:04:27,078
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:27,687 --> 01:04:29,517
Take the next one.

445
01:04:29,718 --> 01:04:32,587
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

446
01:04:32,988 --> 01:04:34,548
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:34,758 --> 01:04:37,087
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

448
01:05:08,227 --> 01:05:09,747
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:48,937 --> 01:05:54,138
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

450
01:05:57,647 --> 01:05:59,325
Does he know we've been watching him?

451
01:05:59,408 --> 01:06:02,078
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:02,278 --> 01:06:06,618
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

453
01:06:07,247 --> 01:06:09,334
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here...

454
01:06:09,417 --> 01:06:13,147
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:14,698 --> 01:06:16,488
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:16,928 --> 01:06:20,457
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

457
01:06:21,067 --> 01:06:23,997
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

458
01:06:24,207 --> 01:06:26,107
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:26,308 --> 01:06:27,868
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:28,937 --> 01:06:31,138
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

461
01:06:31,348 --> 01:06:33,308
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:33,508 --> 01:06:36,138
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:36,348 --> 01:06:39,508
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:39,718 --> 01:06:42,917
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:52,187
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:52,397 --> 01:06:56,357
...but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.

467
01:06:57,437 --> 01:07:00,638
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

468
01:07:00,837 --> 01:07:03,107
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:07,738
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

470
01:07:07,948 --> 01:07:11,537
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:11,747 --> 01:07:16,087
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:19,028 --> 01:07:21,647
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:07:27,127 --> 01:07:28,497
Yes?

474
01:07:29,167 --> 01:07:30,828
For you.

475
01:07:32,008 --> 01:07:34,497
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:36,977 --> 01:07:38,377
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:38,508 --> 01:07:40,934
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:41,017 --> 01:07:43,495
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

479
01:07:43,578 --> 01:07:45,308
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:45,517 --> 01:07:47,917
Do you think you can do that for me?

481
01:07:48,118 --> 01:07:50,058
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:51,127 --> 01:07:53,058
Thank you.

483
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:06,298
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:07,508 --> 01:08:09,837
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

485
01:08:10,037 --> 01:08:11,198
This is the latter.

486
01:08:11,408 --> 01:08:14,607
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

487
01:08:15,048 --> 01:08:16,678
How...?

488
01:08:17,487 --> 01:08:18,947
It's tailored.

489
01:08:19,148 --> 01:08:21,707
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:15,407 --> 01:09:18,037
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

491
01:09:19,978 --> 01:09:21,638
Thank you.

492
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:34,548
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:34,758 --> 01:09:36,858
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:38,068 --> 01:09:40,858
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

495
01:09:41,068 --> 01:09:43,497
Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?

496
01:09:52,947 --> 01:09:54,938
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:55,148 --> 01:09:57,737
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

498
01:09:57,947 --> 01:09:59,888
Five communal cards, two in the hole.

499
01:10:00,348 --> 01:10:03,235
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:03,318 --> 01:10:04,548
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:06,858 --> 01:10:09,388
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:09,598 --> 01:10:12,614
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:12,697 --> 01:10:14,914
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

504
01:10:14,997 --> 01:10:17,855
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

505
01:10:17,938 --> 01:10:19,138
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:19,308 --> 01:10:21,154
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

507
01:10:21,237 --> 01:10:23,637
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:23,938 --> 01:10:25,667
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:26,108 --> 01:10:27,395
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:27,478 --> 01:10:30,228
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

511
01:10:38,327 --> 01:10:39,487
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:52,568 --> 01:10:55,237
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:03,577
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:03,777 --> 01:11:06,808
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:07,018 --> 01:11:10,478
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

516
01:11:12,587 --> 01:11:14,617
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:39,577
Four players.

518
01:11:42,188 --> 01:11:43,518
It's your bet.

519
01:11:45,058 --> 01:11:46,527
Check.

520
01:11:46,728 --> 01:11:48,518
Check.

521
01:11:52,827 --> 01:11:54,888
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:08,117 --> 01:12:09,377
Call.

523
01:12:12,648 --> 01:12:13,917
Fold.

524
01:12:16,117 --> 01:12:18,518
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:22,827 --> 01:12:24,258
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:35,777 --> 01:12:38,337
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:41,447 --> 01:12:44,438
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

528
01:12:44,648 --> 01:12:47,678
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:48,218 --> 01:12:50,417
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:54,228 --> 01:12:56,627
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:58,598 --> 01:12:59,787
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:12:59,997 --> 01:13:02,657
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:03,468 --> 01:13:05,197
Call.

534
01:13:10,337 --> 01:13:11,497
Hello.

535
01:13:11,707 --> 01:13:15,308
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:15,518 --> 01:13:18,638
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

537
01:13:18,848 --> 01:13:19,848
Champagne.

538
01:13:23,518 --> 01:13:25,388
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:36,468 --> 01:13:37,768
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:44,178 --> 01:13:47,938
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

541
01:13:49,617 --> 01:13:52,777
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:52,987 --> 01:13:54,777
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:57,688 --> 01:13:59,018
Fold.

544
01:14:06,398 --> 01:14:08,728
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:16,877 --> 01:14:19,678
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:21,694
Three measures Gordon's, one of vodka...

547
01:14:21,777 --> 01:14:23,735
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

548
01:14:23,818 --> 01:14:26,648
- ...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

549
01:14:26,848 --> 01:14:29,718
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

550
01:14:30,688 --> 01:14:31,917
Certainly.

551
01:14:32,858 --> 01:14:36,758
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:37,627 --> 01:14:38,957
That's it?

553
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:41,858
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:42,068 --> 01:14:43,228
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:52,247 --> 01:14:54,178
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:07,688 --> 01:15:09,027
You taste nice.

557
01:15:09,228 --> 01:15:12,157
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

558
01:15:12,367 --> 01:15:16,058
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:16,268 --> 01:15:17,787
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

560
01:15:18,008 --> 01:15:19,058
Good.

561
01:15:19,268 --> 01:15:22,154
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:22,237 --> 01:15:24,008
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:24,207 --> 01:15:27,178
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

564
01:15:27,808 --> 01:15:29,367
Check.

565
01:15:30,018 --> 01:15:31,965
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

566
01:15:32,048 --> 01:15:34,148
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

567
01:15:35,487 --> 01:15:38,048
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:38,388 --> 01:15:39,648
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,027 --> 01:15:42,077
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.

570
01:15:42,258 --> 01:15:46,388
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:46,598 --> 01:15:48,914
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

572
01:15:48,997 --> 01:15:51,084
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

573
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,697
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:52,907 --> 01:15:54,737
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

575
01:15:54,938 --> 01:15:56,808
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,008 --> 01:15:58,527
Thank you.

577
01:16:00,348 --> 01:16:01,895
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:01,978 --> 01:16:05,008
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:05,848 --> 01:16:07,287
Call.

580
01:16:08,888 --> 01:16:10,858
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:13,388 --> 01:16:15,917
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:16,127 --> 01:16:18,015
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

583
01:16:18,098 --> 01:16:22,558
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:57,167
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:58,768 --> 01:17:00,638
So?

586
01:17:00,837 --> 01:17:02,968
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:03,178 --> 01:17:04,508
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:04,707 --> 01:17:07,907
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:31,608 --> 01:17:35,228
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:37,678 --> 01:17:39,268
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:42,148 --> 01:17:43,707
Where is my money?

592
01:17:48,258 --> 01:17:49,574
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

593
01:17:49,657 --> 01:17:51,888
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:56,527 --> 01:17:58,188
Thank you.

595
01:17:59,468 --> 01:18:03,627
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:04,167 --> 01:18:05,968
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:07,768 --> 01:18:09,497
Open that.

598
01:18:25,527 --> 01:18:27,577
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:28,527 --> 01:18:29,827
All of it.

600
01:18:43,308 --> 01:18:47,268
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:51,818 --> 01:18:53,548
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:54,818 --> 01:18:56,617
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:57,258 --> 01:18:58,848
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:08,768 --> 01:19:11,697
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:25,048 --> 01:19:26,048
Stairs.

606
01:19:30,518 --> 01:19:33,148
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:33,758 --> 01:19:36,318
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:38,487 --> 01:21:40,178
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:40,388 --> 01:21:43,735
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:43,818 --> 01:21:46,848
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:49,688 --> 01:22:52,277
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:52,627 --> 01:22:56,318
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:56,527 --> 01:22:57,758
A little.

614
01:22:57,957 --> 01:23:01,557
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:01,737 --> 01:23:05,758
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:06,997 --> 01:24:11,367
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

617
01:24:12,407 --> 01:24:14,268
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:29,858 --> 01:24:31,688
That's better.

619
01:24:35,758 --> 01:24:37,087
You cold?

620
01:24:37,298 --> 01:24:38,697
Yeah.

621
01:24:38,898 --> 01:24:40,798
Here.

622
01:25:37,518 --> 01:25:39,787
You have any trouble with the bodies?

623
01:25:40,157 --> 01:25:42,287
Less than some.

624
01:25:56,077 --> 01:25:59,808
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:00,747 --> 01:26:03,438
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:03,648 --> 01:26:06,048
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

627
01:26:07,518 --> 01:26:09,747
How's our girl?

628
01:26:10,287 --> 01:26:13,487
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:31,407 --> 01:26:32,608
Call.

630
01:26:32,808 --> 01:26:34,207
Fold.

631
01:26:34,407 --> 01:26:36,377
And call.

632
01:26:37,678 --> 01:26:39,737
Three players.

633
01:26:43,358 --> 01:26:45,117
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:45,327 --> 01:26:46,987
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:48,858 --> 01:26:50,518
Call.

636
01:26:52,268 --> 01:26:53,268
And call.

637
01:26:58,398 --> 01:26:59,697
Three players.

638
01:27:04,037 --> 01:27:05,037
Check.

639
01:27:10,548 --> 01:27:11,707
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:21,587 --> 01:27:24,027
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:35,707 --> 01:27:40,008
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:40,207 --> 01:27:42,237
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:43,348 --> 01:27:45,277
It's up to you.

644
01:27:51,417 --> 01:27:53,818
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:00,898 --> 01:28:03,268
Seems someone knows something I don't.

646
01:28:04,298 --> 01:28:05,497
Fold.

647
01:28:05,707 --> 01:28:07,468
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:07,667 --> 01:28:09,228
It's up to you.

649
01:28:23,417 --> 01:28:24,888
Two.

650
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:27,747
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:29,728 --> 01:28:31,787
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:42,877 --> 01:28:44,737
I'm all in.

653
01:28:52,148 --> 01:28:54,518
Well, it's 14 million and 500,000.

654
01:28:54,718 --> 01:28:57,048
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:28:59,688 --> 01:29:04,058
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

656
01:29:04,997 --> 01:29:07,728
- Call.
- Call.

657
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:10,527
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:12,268 --> 01:29:14,667
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:16,898
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:29,858 --> 01:29:33,548
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:37,558 --> 01:29:40,728
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:41,398 --> 01:29:42,558
Please.

663
01:29:42,768 --> 01:29:45,068
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:45,268 --> 01:29:48,598
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:56,048 --> 01:29:57,707
Good game.

666
01:30:25,848 --> 01:30:29,178
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:29,747 --> 01:30:32,077
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:32,617 --> 01:30:35,018
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:35,818 --> 01:30:38,808
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,027 --> 01:30:40,457
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

671
01:30:41,527 --> 01:30:42,957
Sorry?

672
01:30:43,157 --> 01:30:44,928
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:45,127 --> 01:30:46,645
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:46,728 --> 01:30:49,185
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:49,268 --> 01:30:52,327
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:52,537 --> 01:30:53,938
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:54,138 --> 01:30:56,138
All you're going to do now is lose more.

678
01:30:56,737 --> 01:30:57,898
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:58,108 --> 01:31:00,978
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:02,877 --> 01:31:05,148
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:05,917 --> 01:31:07,678
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:10,318 --> 01:31:12,917
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:35,818 --> 01:31:36,978
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:37,178 --> 01:31:39,978
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:58,167 --> 01:32:00,438
- James.
- Get the girl out.

686
01:32:07,707 --> 01:32:08,707
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:08,877 --> 01:32:11,978
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:12,718 --> 01:32:15,808
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:17,818 --> 01:32:19,345
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:19,428 --> 01:32:22,044
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

691
01:32:22,127 --> 01:32:24,388
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:24,827 --> 01:32:26,758
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:28,468 --> 01:32:29,827
No.

694
01:32:33,167 --> 01:32:37,108
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:37,308 --> 01:32:39,968
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

696
01:32:41,048 --> 01:32:43,265
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

697
01:32:43,348 --> 01:32:48,218
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:49,587 --> 01:32:51,917
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:52,627 --> 01:32:55,188
Does it look like we need the money?

700
01:33:06,737 --> 01:33:08,827
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,037 --> 01:33:12,737
Why not?

702
01:33:16,218 --> 01:33:17,707
Bet.

703
01:33:19,787 --> 01:33:21,447
Raise.

704
01:33:36,968 --> 01:33:38,898
And fold.

705
01:33:41,138 --> 01:33:43,108
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:44,808 --> 01:33:46,438
Call.

707
01:33:47,907 --> 01:33:49,138
Raise.

708
01:33:49,348 --> 01:33:52,808
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:55,318 --> 01:33:57,258
- Fold.
- Thank you.

710
01:33:59,627 --> 01:34:00,787
Fold.

711
01:34:05,058 --> 01:34:06,587
Fold.

712
01:34:11,497 --> 01:34:12,938
Thank you.

713
01:34:13,138 --> 01:34:14,138
Wins.

714
01:34:35,228 --> 01:34:36,388
Deal me out.

715
01:34:37,398 --> 01:34:40,518
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:42,497 --> 01:34:44,058
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:48,167 --> 01:35:50,568
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

718
01:35:52,237 --> 01:35:54,837
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:56,978 --> 01:35:59,525
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

720
01:35:59,608 --> 01:36:02,465
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:02,548 --> 01:36:03,707
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:03,917 --> 01:36:05,565
Remove the defibrillator from the pouch.

723
01:36:05,648 --> 01:36:08,198
- Do we know what it is yet?
- We're still scanning.

724
01:36:13,627 --> 01:36:16,358
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:24,997 --> 01:36:26,968
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:27,268 --> 01:36:30,194
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:30,277 --> 01:36:31,898
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

728
01:36:32,108 --> 01:36:34,965
- As soon as it reads charged...
- Lidocaine. That'll work.

729
01:36:35,048 --> 01:36:37,635
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:37,718 --> 01:36:39,148
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:39,348 --> 01:36:41,998
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

732
01:36:42,718 --> 01:36:46,587
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:46,787 --> 01:36:49,087
That'll counteract the digitalis.

734
01:36:52,398 --> 01:36:54,315
You're going to pass out in a few seconds.

735
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:55,954
You need to keep your heart going.

736
01:36:56,037 --> 01:36:57,537
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:03,377 --> 01:37:05,808
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

738
01:37:53,688 --> 01:37:55,657
- You okay?
- Me?

739
01:37:58,997 --> 01:38:01,587
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

740
01:38:01,798 --> 01:38:05,457
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

741
01:38:06,468 --> 01:38:07,968
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:08,068 --> 01:38:10,798
You're not seriously going back there?

743
01:38:13,377 --> 01:38:15,277
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:16,917 --> 01:38:18,508
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:22,247 --> 01:38:23,808
- All in.
- Call. All in.

746
01:38:24,018 --> 01:38:26,617
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:28,627 --> 01:38:30,527
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:34,468 --> 01:38:36,898
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:45,478 --> 01:38:46,667
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:46,877 --> 01:38:49,438
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:50,877 --> 01:38:54,577
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:54,688 --> 01:38:56,447
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:56,657 --> 01:38:59,848
The big blind is now 1 million dollars.

754
01:39:06,928 --> 01:39:08,058
Four players.

755
01:39:10,867 --> 01:39:12,228
It's your bet.

756
01:39:16,277 --> 01:39:17,477
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

757
01:39:17,638 --> 01:39:21,478
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:24,348 --> 01:39:26,478
Check. And check.

759
01:39:26,917 --> 01:39:28,508
All check.

760
01:39:28,848 --> 01:39:30,048
Four players.

761
01:39:35,058 --> 01:39:36,457
- Check.
- Check.

762
01:39:42,367 --> 01:39:44,527
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:45,438 --> 01:39:47,957
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:53,407 --> 01:39:55,737
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:55,947 --> 01:39:58,508
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:06,027 --> 01:40:07,358
Raise.

767
01:40:08,928 --> 01:40:10,117
Raise.

768
01:40:10,327 --> 01:40:13,587
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:44,197 --> 01:40:47,318
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:49,768 --> 01:40:51,598
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:10,487 --> 01:41:14,077
Well, I think I will call you on that one.

772
01:41:20,928 --> 01:41:22,127
Call.

773
01:41:34,008 --> 01:41:38,207
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

774
01:41:38,417 --> 01:41:41,148
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:44,787 --> 01:41:46,718
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:55,298 --> 01:41:58,287
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:16,457 --> 01:42:18,577
A higher full house.

778
01:42:18,787 --> 01:42:20,258
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:26,268 --> 01:42:27,457
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:44,518 --> 01:42:47,008
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:47,218 --> 01:42:48,688
A straight flush.

782
01:42:48,888 --> 01:42:50,178
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:50,388 --> 01:42:52,478
The high hand.

784
01:42:57,197 --> 01:42:58,718
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:42:59,728 --> 01:43:02,027
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

786
01:43:04,468 --> 01:43:05,657
Congratulations.

787
01:43:05,867 --> 01:43:09,398
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:16,377 --> 01:43:17,537
Congratulations.

789
01:43:17,747 --> 01:43:19,735
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:19,818 --> 01:43:22,337
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:23,218 --> 01:43:26,207
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:36,638 --> 01:43:38,497
Thank you.

793
01:43:46,108 --> 01:43:50,008
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:50,218 --> 01:43:52,837
They're going to extract him before dawn.

795
01:43:53,548 --> 01:43:55,648
You know, I think I'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:56,917 --> 01:43:58,718
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:43:58,917 --> 01:44:03,087
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:05,697 --> 01:44:08,947
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

799
01:44:10,037 --> 01:44:11,527
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:11,867 --> 01:44:16,138
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:22,447 --> 01:44:24,008
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:26,447 --> 01:44:28,718
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:28,917 --> 01:44:32,117
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

804
01:44:32,318 --> 01:44:33,947
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:34,858 --> 01:44:36,327
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:40,027 --> 01:44:41,758
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:48,268 --> 01:44:51,108
You can switch off so easily, can't you?

808
01:44:51,478 --> 01:44:53,667
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

809
01:44:54,277 --> 01:44:57,308
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

810
01:44:58,247 --> 01:45:00,478
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:01,117 --> 01:45:03,277
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:03,487 --> 01:45:05,204
Just because you've done something...

813
01:45:05,287 --> 01:45:07,417
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:07,627 --> 01:45:10,645
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

815
01:45:10,728 --> 01:45:12,697
You think I can't take my own advice?

816
01:45:13,598 --> 01:45:16,258
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:16,798 --> 01:45:18,998
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

818
01:45:24,777 --> 01:45:26,898
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:27,577 --> 01:45:28,837
Good night.

820
01:45:29,048 --> 01:45:30,377
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:49,667 --> 01:45:51,497
Mathis.

822
01:47:43,447 --> 01:47:47,377
I'm afraid your friend Mathis is really...

823
01:47:48,648 --> 01:47:50,447
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:33,228 --> 01:49:35,957
You've taken good care of your body.

825
01:49:42,497 --> 01:49:44,987
Such a waste.

826
01:50:02,247 --> 01:50:04,087
You know...

827
01:50:04,457 --> 01:50:07,577
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

828
01:50:07,787 --> 01:50:09,987
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:50:10,197 --> 01:50:13,718
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:15,228 --> 01:50:16,388
And of course...

831
01:50:16,598 --> 01:50:19,568
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

832
01:50:19,768 --> 01:50:22,428
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

833
01:50:23,138 --> 01:50:26,768
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

834
01:50:32,848 --> 01:50:34,747
The only question remains...

835
01:50:36,247 --> 01:50:38,417
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:40,487 --> 01:50:43,617
I want the money.

837
01:51:02,348 --> 01:51:05,777
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

838
01:51:05,978 --> 01:51:08,348
So all I need from you is the password.

839
01:51:18,127 --> 01:51:21,358
The password, please.

840
01:51:25,598 --> 01:51:27,898
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:28,108 --> 01:51:29,968
...down there.

842
01:51:30,737 --> 01:51:32,207
Would you mind?

843
01:51:39,947 --> 01:51:43,348
No! No! No!

844
01:51:44,318 --> 01:51:48,018
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

845
01:51:48,228 --> 01:51:50,657
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:52,598 --> 01:51:54,087
Yeah!

847
01:51:55,327 --> 01:51:58,627
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:52:04,308 --> 01:52:09,747
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

849
01:52:11,048 --> 01:52:13,037
I died?

850
01:52:13,247 --> 01:52:14,548
- I died?
- Yes.

851
01:52:14,747 --> 01:52:17,834
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:17,917 --> 01:52:19,874
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

853
01:52:19,957 --> 01:52:22,904
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

854
01:52:22,987 --> 01:52:24,388
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:24,598 --> 01:52:26,657
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:26,867 --> 01:52:29,657
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:29,867 --> 01:52:32,985
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:33,068 --> 01:52:35,867
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

859
01:52:37,407 --> 01:52:41,037
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:42,277 --> 01:52:44,337
The big picture.

861
01:52:52,258 --> 01:52:54,487
Give me the password...

862
01:52:54,688 --> 01:52:56,627
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:53:00,298 --> 01:53:03,388
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:16,478 --> 01:53:18,628
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

865
01:53:18,818 --> 01:53:20,608
No.

866
01:53:22,447 --> 01:53:24,348
So I think...

867
01:53:28,888 --> 01:53:32,327
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

868
01:53:45,478 --> 01:53:47,737
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:48,648 --> 01:53:51,138
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:51,348 --> 01:53:55,808
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:19,438 --> 01:54:20,837
Francesco.

872
01:54:21,777 --> 01:54:23,678
Francesco.

873
01:54:36,388 --> 01:54:38,518
Vesper.

874
01:54:40,398 --> 01:54:42,298
Vesper.

875
01:54:44,438 --> 01:54:45,957
No.

876
01:54:46,768 --> 01:54:48,098
Not him.

877
01:54:48,308 --> 01:54:50,207
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:52,037 --> 01:54:53,197
No.

879
01:54:54,048 --> 01:54:56,068
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:58,848 --> 01:55:00,648
Not him.

881
01:55:02,548 --> 01:55:03,707
Any ideas?

882
01:55:07,457 --> 01:55:11,287
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:13,298 --> 01:55:14,728
Where is she?

884
01:55:15,768 --> 01:55:17,667
Sleeping.

885
01:55:18,268 --> 01:55:21,527
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

886
01:55:22,638 --> 01:55:24,298
It's just odd...

887
01:55:24,508 --> 01:55:28,407
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:28,608 --> 01:55:31,947
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:33,117 --> 01:55:35,237
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:35,787 --> 01:55:37,518
No.

891
01:55:38,987 --> 01:55:40,417
Shame.

892
01:55:42,087 --> 01:55:43,818
Drink up.

893
01:55:47,228 --> 01:55:49,388
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:49,598 --> 01:55:51,627
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:51,837 --> 01:55:53,457
Help us?

896
01:55:53,667 --> 01:55:55,898
Or help you?

897
01:56:36,277 --> 01:56:37,438
Hello.

898
01:56:37,648 --> 01:56:39,478
Hello.

899
01:56:41,188 --> 01:56:42,478
You all right?

900
01:56:43,117 --> 01:56:45,277
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:45,487 --> 01:56:50,117
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:51,258 --> 01:56:53,247
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:56,997 --> 01:57:00,098
If you'd just been born...

904
01:57:00,768 --> 01:57:03,037
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:57:03,808 --> 01:57:05,997
You have me there.

906
01:57:08,678 --> 01:57:11,377
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:13,447 --> 01:57:14,978
I can?

908
01:57:15,188 --> 01:57:19,048
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

909
01:57:20,058 --> 01:57:22,957
Does this mean that you're warming to me?

910
01:57:23,157 --> 01:57:25,358
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:25,558 --> 01:57:27,114
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:27,197 --> 01:57:31,068
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

913
01:57:32,537 --> 01:57:35,167
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:35,737 --> 01:57:38,638
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:39,178 --> 01:57:41,667
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:44,447 --> 01:57:48,077
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:49,518 --> 01:57:52,247
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:52,457 --> 01:57:54,447
My apologies, I do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:54,657 --> 01:57:56,757
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

920
01:57:56,858 --> 01:57:59,708
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

921
01:57:59,898 --> 01:58:02,018
I'm afraid not.

922
01:58:03,228 --> 01:58:06,098
If you would type in the account number.

923
01:58:13,178 --> 01:58:14,577
And now the password.

924
01:58:15,377 --> 01:58:16,537
You can do that.

925
01:58:17,247 --> 01:58:19,308
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:19,917 --> 01:58:21,917
V-E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:37,138 --> 01:58:38,928
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:39,138 --> 01:58:41,997
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:43,837 --> 01:58:47,068
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:53,648 --> 01:58:55,048
You know, James...

931
01:58:57,657 --> 01:59:00,675
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

932
01:59:00,758 --> 01:59:04,058
...was your smile
and your little finger...

933
01:59:04,258 --> 01:59:07,108
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:16,407 --> 01:59:20,068
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:22,947 --> 01:59:26,818
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:30,087 --> 01:59:34,018
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

937
01:59:34,758 --> 01:59:36,888
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:37,087 --> 01:59:38,318
That's that.

939
01:59:39,827 --> 01:59:42,388
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:43,627 --> 01:59:46,127
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:46,997 --> 01:59:49,468
Whatever is left of me...

942
01:59:49,938 --> 01:59:52,808
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:53,638 --> 01:59:55,608
...whatever I am...

944
01:59:55,808 --> 01:59:58,298
...I'm yours.

945
02:00:59,737 --> 02:01:02,737
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

946
02:01:03,478 --> 02:01:05,308
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

947
02:01:05,518 --> 02:01:06,707
Mathis?

948
02:01:06,917 --> 02:01:09,065
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

949
02:01:09,148 --> 02:01:11,587
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

950
02:01:12,157 --> 02:01:13,707
That's how he wiped me out.

951
02:01:13,928 --> 02:01:17,587
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

952
02:01:17,798 --> 02:01:19,987
I can't believe it.

953
02:01:20,197 --> 02:01:21,787
No, neither could I.

954
02:01:22,268 --> 02:01:24,667
I thought he had my back.

955
02:01:25,337 --> 02:01:27,127
But there you go, lesson learned.

956
02:01:28,537 --> 02:01:30,938
Does everyone have a tell?

957
02:01:32,877 --> 02:01:34,608
Yes.

958
02:01:37,548 --> 02:01:39,308
Everyone.

959
02:01:39,718 --> 02:01:41,548
Everyone except you.

960
02:01:46,018 --> 02:01:48,048
I wonder if that's why I love you.

961
02:01:50,087 --> 02:01:52,027
You love me?

962
02:01:52,558 --> 02:01:54,944
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

963
02:01:55,027 --> 02:01:57,228
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

964
02:01:57,867 --> 02:02:01,928
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

965
02:02:02,837 --> 02:02:04,268
You're serious.

966
02:02:05,237 --> 02:02:07,138
Like you said...

967
02:02:07,707 --> 02:02:09,457
...you do what I do for too long...

968
02:02:09,608 --> 02:02:12,407
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

969
02:02:12,617 --> 02:02:15,478
I'm leaving with what little I have left.

970
02:02:17,487 --> 02:02:19,577
Is that enough for you?

971
02:04:03,928 --> 02:04:05,827
- Come on.
- No. No.

972
02:04:06,327 --> 02:04:09,527
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

973
02:04:09,728 --> 02:04:11,928
What's the time?

974
02:04:14,167 --> 02:04:16,228
How much do we need to float for a month?

975
02:04:16,707 --> 02:04:18,468
I've got plenty.

976
02:04:18,678 --> 02:04:22,608
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

977
02:04:25,548 --> 02:04:27,877
You stopped wearing the necklace.

978
02:04:28,087 --> 02:04:31,247
Yeah. It was time.

979
02:04:31,457 --> 02:04:34,188
Time enough to get over someone?

980
02:04:38,957 --> 02:04:42,327
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

981
02:04:51,037 --> 02:04:52,938
Though apparently not your employer.

982
02:04:57,377 --> 02:05:00,608
Back in one month.

983
02:05:01,688 --> 02:05:04,087
Come on. I'll get the money...

984
02:05:04,287 --> 02:05:06,447
...you get supplies.

985
02:05:36,117 --> 02:05:38,548
I'll see you back here in half an hour.

986
02:06:03,048 --> 02:06:05,478
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

987
02:06:05,678 --> 02:06:07,337
Yes?

988
02:06:07,548 --> 02:06:09,377
We'll talk about that later.

989
02:06:09,587 --> 02:06:12,577
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

990
02:06:12,787 --> 02:06:15,637
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

991
02:06:19,058 --> 02:06:21,898
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

992
02:06:22,098 --> 02:06:25,398
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

993
02:06:25,598 --> 02:06:27,758
So you'll be depositing it today.

994
02:06:28,108 --> 02:06:30,728
On my way to the bank right now.

995
02:06:31,138 --> 02:06:33,837
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

996
02:06:34,308 --> 02:06:35,468
Hello.

997
02:06:35,678 --> 02:06:36,778
Mr. Mendel?

998
02:06:36,929 --> 02:06:39,194
I'm having trouble accessing
the funds in my account.

999
02:06:39,277 --> 02:06:41,235
It was transferred
to the account number...

1000
02:06:41,318 --> 02:06:43,617
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:06:46,258 --> 02:06:49,657
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:06:52,358 --> 02:06:54,308
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:06:54,398 --> 02:06:55,627
St. Mark's Square.

1004
02:06:57,997 --> 02:06:59,697
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

1005
02:09:12,398 --> 02:09:13,558
I'll kill her!

1006
02:09:14,568 --> 02:09:15,768
Allow me.

1007
02:13:35,697 --> 02:13:37,667
I'm sorry, James.

1008
02:16:49,328 --> 02:16:52,058
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1009
02:16:52,257 --> 02:16:54,318
They were very much in love.

1010
02:16:54,728 --> 02:16:57,857
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1011
02:16:58,068 --> 02:17:03,027
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:17:03,238 --> 02:17:04,725
We should've picked up on it...

1013
02:17:04,808 --> 02:17:07,155
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1014
02:17:07,238 --> 02:17:08,938
...we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:17:10,408 --> 02:17:12,277
How are you doing?

1016
02:17:12,617 --> 02:17:14,847
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:17:15,048 --> 02:17:17,418
She must have known I'd check it.

1018
02:17:18,218 --> 02:17:20,377
She knew you were you.

1019
02:17:21,457 --> 02:17:23,687
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- No.

1020
02:17:23,888 --> 02:17:25,517
- No?
- No.

1021
02:17:25,728 --> 02:17:28,344
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1022
02:17:28,427 --> 02:17:30,927
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:17:31,568 --> 02:17:33,454
You don't trust anyone, do you, James?

1024
02:17:33,537 --> 02:17:35,158
No.

1025
02:17:35,668 --> 02:17:37,937
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1026
02:17:38,738 --> 02:17:40,937
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:17:41,677 --> 02:17:42,838
Will do.

1028
02:17:45,117 --> 02:17:46,478
If you do need time...

1029
02:17:46,677 --> 02:17:48,077
Why should I need more time?

1030
02:17:49,088 --> 02:17:52,347
The job's done, and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:17:53,287 --> 02:17:55,088
James...

1032
02:17:55,728 --> 02:17:59,127
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1033
02:17:59,728 --> 02:18:01,418
Isn't it obvious?

1034
02:18:01,627 --> 02:18:05,588
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1035
02:18:05,798 --> 02:18:07,957
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1036
02:18:09,537 --> 02:18:12,527
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:18:13,638 --> 02:18:16,578
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

1038
02:18:16,777 --> 02:18:19,338
The trail's gone cold.

1039
02:19:46,867 --> 02:19:48,767
- Hello.
- Mr. White?

1040
02:19:48,968 --> 02:19:50,457
We need to talk.

1041
02:19:50,668 --> 02:19:52,537
Who is this?

1042
02:20:22,838 --> 02:20:24,828
The name's Bond.

1043
02:20:25,037 --> 02:20:26,978
James Bond.

1044
02:24:31,298 --> 02:24:32,798
...English...
