1
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:17,498
M doesn't mind you earning
a little money on the side, Dryden.

2
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:21,088
She'd just prefer it
if it wasn't selling secrets.

3
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,817
If the theatrics
are supposed to scare me...

4
00:01:33,008 --> 00:01:35,497
...you have the wrong man, Bond.

5
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:39,068
If M was so sure that I was bent...

6
00:01:39,277 --> 00:01:41,207
...she'd have sent a double-0.

7
00:01:42,218 --> 00:01:44,618
Benefits of being section chief...

8
00:01:44,818 --> 00:01:47,605
...I'd know if anyone had been
promoted to double-0 status...

9
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:48,978
...wouldn't I?

10
00:01:50,088 --> 00:01:54,577
- Your file shows no kills, and it takes...
- Two.

11
00:02:11,778 --> 00:02:13,538
Shame.

12
00:02:13,908 --> 00:02:16,207
We barely got to know each other.

13
00:02:19,887 --> 00:02:21,438
I know where you keep your gun.

14
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:25,478
I suppose that's something.

15
00:02:26,827 --> 00:02:28,848
True.

16
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,087
How did he die?

17
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:32,758
Your contact?

18
00:02:33,468 --> 00:02:34,468
Not well.

19
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,408
Made you feel it, did he?

20
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:26,647
Well...

21
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:29,077
...you needn't worry.

22
00:03:29,618 --> 00:03:31,207
The second is...

23
00:03:35,188 --> 00:03:37,027
Yes.

24
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,887
Considerably.

25
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:37,097
So how do I trust this man
that I've never met with my money?

26
00:07:37,438 --> 00:07:39,868
You asked for the introduction.

27
00:07:40,068 --> 00:07:42,298
That's all my organization will guarantee.

28
00:08:22,647 --> 00:08:25,378
I suppose our friend
Mr. White will have told you...

29
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:27,965
...that I have provided
reliable banking services...

30
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,748
...for many other
freedom fighters over the years.

31
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:37,827
Do you believe in God,
Mr. Le Chiffre?

32
00:08:38,028 --> 00:08:39,658
No.

33
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:42,528
I believe in a reasonable rate of return.

34
00:08:42,737 --> 00:08:44,997
I want no risk in the portfolio.

35
00:08:45,198 --> 00:08:46,467
Agreed.

36
00:08:46,668 --> 00:08:48,685
And I can access it anywhere in the world?

37
00:08:48,768 --> 00:08:49,867
Yes.

38
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:11,058
I have the money,
so short another million shares...

39
00:09:11,257 --> 00:09:12,918
...of Skyfleet stock.

40
00:09:13,127 --> 00:09:16,997
Sir, you must know you're betting
against the market.

41
00:09:17,198 --> 00:09:20,367
No one expects this stock
to go anywhere but up.

42
00:09:20,568 --> 00:09:23,268
Just do it.

43
00:09:58,038 --> 00:10:00,507
Looks like our man.
Burn scars on his face.

44
00:10:03,077 --> 00:10:05,877
I wonder if bomb-makers
are insured for things like that.

45
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:21,967
He's on the move.

46
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:25,097
He's on the move,
and he's heading straight for me.

47
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:27,957
Stop touching your ear.

48
00:10:28,168 --> 00:10:30,227
- Sorry?
- Put your hand down.

49
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:39,267
Holster the bloody weapon, Carter.
I need him alive.

50
00:20:10,457 --> 00:20:13,474
Weeping blood comes merely
from a derangement of the tear duct...

51
00:20:13,557 --> 00:20:14,957
...my dear general.

52
00:20:15,928 --> 00:20:17,188
Nothing sinister.

53
00:20:22,467 --> 00:20:23,828
All in.

54
00:20:26,737 --> 00:20:29,757
I have two pair, and you have
a 17.4 percent chance...

55
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:32,067
...of making your straight.

56
00:20:58,497 --> 00:21:00,838
When does Ellipsis expire?

57
00:21:01,037 --> 00:21:04,198
- We have less than 36 hours. I can...
- No. No, no.

58
00:21:04,408 --> 00:21:07,138
That's all the time I have anyway.

59
00:21:08,878 --> 00:21:11,078
Give our guests five minutes to leave...

60
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:13,578
...or throw them overboard.

61
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,928
Who the hell do they think they are?

62
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:29,714
I report to the prime minister,
even he's smart enough...

63
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:31,115
...not to ask me what we do.

64
00:21:31,198 --> 00:21:34,898
Have you ever seen such a bunch
of self-righteous, arse-covering prigs?

65
00:21:35,108 --> 00:21:38,124
They don't care what we do, they care
what we get photographed doing.

66
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:40,767
And how the hell could Bond be so stupid?

67
00:21:40,977 --> 00:21:43,964
I give him double-0 status,
he celebrates by shooting an embassy.

68
00:21:44,047 --> 00:21:46,448
Is the man deranged?
And where the hell is he?

69
00:21:46,648 --> 00:21:49,305
In the old days, if an agent
did something embarrassing...

70
00:21:49,388 --> 00:21:51,134
...he'd have the good sense
to defect.

71
00:21:51,217 --> 00:21:53,047
Christ, I miss the Cold War.

72
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,328
You've got a bloody cheek.

73
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:13,027
Sorry.

74
00:23:13,237 --> 00:23:15,137
I'll shoot the camera first next time.

75
00:23:15,237 --> 00:23:16,898
Or yourself.

76
00:23:17,108 --> 00:23:19,128
You stormed into an embassy.

77
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:21,868
You violated the only
absolutely inviolate rule...

78
00:23:22,078 --> 00:23:23,778
...of international relationships.

79
00:23:23,878 --> 00:23:25,817
And why?
So you could kill a nobody.

80
00:23:26,017 --> 00:23:28,017
We wanted to question him, not kill him.

81
00:23:29,217 --> 00:23:32,234
For God's sake. You're supposed
to display some kind of judgment.

82
00:23:32,317 --> 00:23:33,378
I did.

83
00:23:34,057 --> 00:23:36,714
I thought one less bomb-maker
in the world would be good.

84
00:23:36,797 --> 00:23:38,588
Exactly. One bomb-maker.

85
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:42,745
We're trying to find out how an entire
network of terrorist groups is financed...

86
00:23:42,828 --> 00:23:44,454
...and you give us one bomb-maker.

87
00:23:44,537 --> 00:23:46,658
Hardly the big picture, wouldn't you say?

88
00:23:46,868 --> 00:23:50,098
The man isn't even a true believer.
He's a gun for hire.

89
00:23:50,307 --> 00:23:52,138
And thanks to your trigger finger...

90
00:23:52,338 --> 00:23:55,207
...we have no idea
who hired him or why.

91
00:23:55,408 --> 00:23:57,758
And how the hell
did you find out where I lived?

92
00:23:57,948 --> 00:23:59,664
The same way I found out your name.

93
00:23:59,747 --> 00:24:02,805
I thought "M" was randomly assigned.
I had no idea it stood for...

94
00:24:02,888 --> 00:24:05,358
Utter one more syllable
and I'll have you killed.

95
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:09,547
I knew it was too early to promote you.

96
00:24:10,098 --> 00:24:14,027
Well, I understand double-0s
have a very short life-expectancy...

97
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,428
...so your mistake will be short-lived.

98
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:27,578
Bond, this may be too much
for a blunt instrument to understand...

99
00:24:27,777 --> 00:24:31,148
...but arrogance and self-awareness
seldom go hand in hand.

100
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:34,477
So you want me to be half monk,
half hit-man?

101
00:24:34,688 --> 00:24:36,547
Any thug can kill.

102
00:24:36,757 --> 00:24:39,207
I want you to take your ego
out of the equation...

103
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:41,878
...and to judge the situation
dispassionately.

104
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:45,858
I have to know I can trust you,
and that you know who to trust.

105
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:50,688
And since I don't know that,
I need you out of my sight.

106
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:53,055
Go and stick your head
in the sand somewhere...

107
00:24:53,138 --> 00:24:54,624
...and think about your future.

108
00:24:54,707 --> 00:24:57,608
Because these bastards want your head.

109
00:24:57,807 --> 00:25:01,267
And I'm seriously considering
feeding you to them.

110
00:25:08,618 --> 00:25:10,608
And Bond...

111
00:25:14,027 --> 00:25:16,618
...don't ever break into
my house again.

112
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:19,497
Ma'am.

113
00:26:32,198 --> 00:26:35,037
Good day, sir,
and welcome to the Ocean Club.

114
00:26:40,047 --> 00:26:42,277
Hey. Hey.

115
00:26:54,457 --> 00:26:56,088
Hello.

116
00:26:56,287 --> 00:26:58,418
Are you going to take this
or make me wait?

117
00:26:59,457 --> 00:27:01,928
Certainly, sir. Sorry, sir.

118
00:27:45,338 --> 00:27:48,277
Security to car park.
Security to car park.

119
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:50,178
Absolutely incredible.

120
00:29:29,277 --> 00:29:31,767
Welcome to the Ocean Club, sir.
Checking in?

121
00:29:31,977 --> 00:29:35,535
Yes. But it's a spur-of-the-moment
thing, and I haven't got a reservation.

122
00:29:35,618 --> 00:29:37,017
Okay.

123
00:29:38,517 --> 00:29:41,888
- We have an ocean-view villa.
- Perfect.

124
00:29:44,928 --> 00:29:47,328
Could you do me a favor?
I was here last night...

125
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:51,418
...and I parked my car next to
a very beautiful 1964 Aston Martin.

126
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:53,855
I nicked the door.
You wouldn't happen to know...?

127
00:29:53,938 --> 00:29:56,368
- Mr. Dimitrios.
- Right.

128
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:59,424
If he hasn't noticed,
I'm not sure I'd mention it.

129
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:01,357
Isn't the type to take bad news well.

130
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:05,047
But if I felt compelled to find him?

131
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:08,307
He has a house just up the beach.

132
00:30:09,948 --> 00:30:11,247
Thank you.

133
00:31:12,348 --> 00:31:15,047
- What?
- He's in the Bahamas.

134
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:17,688
You woke me to share his holiday plans?

135
00:31:17,888 --> 00:31:19,974
Well, he's logged into
our secure website...

136
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:22,118
...using your name and password.

137
00:31:22,328 --> 00:31:25,188
Well, how the hell
does he know these things?

138
00:31:25,398 --> 00:31:27,757
Well, I'm doing my best to find out.

139
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:31,828
- Who's he looking at?
- Alex Dimitrios.

140
00:31:32,237 --> 00:31:33,858
That slimy bugger.

141
00:31:44,448 --> 00:31:46,348
Now known associates...

142
00:31:58,057 --> 00:31:59,497
Le Chiffre.

143
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:18,578
We've had a good night,
we've had a few drinks.

144
00:32:19,517 --> 00:32:21,247
How can I assist you, sir?

145
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:23,798
Good evening.
Large Mount Gay with soda, please.

146
00:32:24,557 --> 00:32:26,634
- Look what just happened.
- Good job, big boy.

147
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:27,948
Yeah.

148
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,914
Do you mind if I join?

149
00:32:36,997 --> 00:32:39,347
- Oh, good evening. How are you?
- Good evening.

150
00:32:50,878 --> 00:32:52,817
Small blind, big blind.

151
00:32:53,017 --> 00:32:54,678
I'm in.

152
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,777
Bet's to you.

153
00:33:01,457 --> 00:33:04,217
If that was for luck,
you're two hours late.

154
00:33:05,828 --> 00:33:08,057
Two hundred to you.

155
00:33:12,938 --> 00:33:14,198
Bet's to you.

156
00:33:14,408 --> 00:33:15,898
I heard you.

157
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:18,297
Five to call.

158
00:33:21,908 --> 00:33:23,325
- Action's to you.
- Pair of sevens.

159
00:33:23,408 --> 00:33:24,777
Ace high.

160
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:27,918
Check or bet.

161
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:29,608
- Check.
- And to you.

162
00:33:29,817 --> 00:33:31,757
Five thousand.

163
00:33:35,828 --> 00:33:37,158
Five to call.

164
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:51,368
- Check.
- Check to you, sir.

165
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:54,368
All in.

166
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:56,838
No, wait.

167
00:33:57,247 --> 00:33:58,717
Twenty thousand.

168
00:33:59,047 --> 00:34:01,448
Table stakes. I'm sorry, sir.

169
00:34:04,017 --> 00:34:08,047
Okay. This is on the table.
That's my car. Wanna bet?

170
00:34:09,728 --> 00:34:11,587
I'm sorry, Mr. Dimitrios.

171
00:34:11,797 --> 00:34:14,788
Please, no. Give him a chance
to win his money back.

172
00:34:25,007 --> 00:34:26,737
All right, show me, gentlemen.

173
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:33,178
Three kings.

174
00:34:39,357 --> 00:34:41,118
There you go with my night.

175
00:34:41,328 --> 00:34:42,717
Trip aces.

176
00:34:42,928 --> 00:34:45,018
Aces win.

177
00:34:48,768 --> 00:34:50,058
Oh, and the valet ticket.

178
00:34:54,408 --> 00:34:55,837
Thank you.

179
00:34:56,038 --> 00:34:57,507
Sir.

180
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,007
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

181
00:35:33,038 --> 00:35:36,208
No wonder he was in such a foul mood.

182
00:35:37,448 --> 00:35:38,638
My mistake.

183
00:35:38,848 --> 00:35:40,198
Can I give you a lift home?

184
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:44,147
That would really send him over the edge.

185
00:35:44,357 --> 00:35:46,288
I'm afraid I'm not that cruel.

186
00:35:46,587 --> 00:35:48,687
Well, perhaps you're just out of practice.

187
00:35:56,368 --> 00:35:57,658
Perhaps.

188
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:59,718
Well, what about a drink at my place?

189
00:36:00,498 --> 00:36:02,498
Your place?

190
00:36:02,937 --> 00:36:05,768
- Is it close?
- Very.

191
00:36:12,178 --> 00:36:14,047
One drink.

192
00:36:39,377 --> 00:36:41,095
Good evening, sir, and welcome back.

193
00:36:41,178 --> 00:36:43,078
Welcome to my home.

194
00:36:55,328 --> 00:36:58,388
I'm having a hard time seeing
how this is my fault.

195
00:36:58,598 --> 00:37:01,257
It's your plan.
All I did was get you the man.

196
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:05,958
A man who was under surveillance
by the British Secret Service.

197
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,237
Which makes me wonder
if I can trust you at all.

198
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:13,007
Then don't. I couldn't care less.

199
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:15,178
But I do care about my reputation.

200
00:37:16,147 --> 00:37:18,377
I have someone else willing to do the job.

201
00:37:18,578 --> 00:37:20,377
He just needs the particulars...

202
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:22,978
...and payment.

203
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:37,587
You like married women, don't you, James?

204
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,998
It keeps things simple.

205
00:37:42,937 --> 00:37:45,737
What is it about bad men?

206
00:37:45,937 --> 00:37:48,908
You, my husband...

207
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:51,777
I had so many chances to be happy...

208
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,348
...so many nice guys.

209
00:37:54,547 --> 00:37:57,248
Why can't nice guys be more like you?

210
00:37:57,458 --> 00:37:59,687
Well, because then they'd be bad.

211
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:02,888
Yes.

212
00:38:05,627 --> 00:38:08,458
But so much more interesting.

213
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:15,337
What makes your husband a bad man?

214
00:38:15,538 --> 00:38:18,098
His nature, I suppose.

215
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:19,967
The nature of his work?

216
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:23,837
A mystery, I'm afraid.

217
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:29,817
I'm also afraid you will sleep with me
in order to get to him.

218
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,487
How afraid?

219
00:38:33,058 --> 00:38:35,857
Not enough to stop.

220
00:38:43,428 --> 00:38:45,598
Can I ask you a personal question?

221
00:38:47,268 --> 00:38:50,928
Now would seem an appropriate time.

222
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:53,507
Does "ellipsis" mean anything to you?

223
00:39:02,848 --> 00:39:04,817
Should I ask him about it?

224
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,348
Perhaps later.

225
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:09,487
Yes, dear?

226
00:39:09,687 --> 00:39:11,687
I'm on the last flight tonight to Miami.

227
00:39:11,797 --> 00:39:14,417
Don't wait up.
I'll be back in the morning.

228
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:16,958
Okay, I understand.

229
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:19,928
See you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

230
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:25,877
Apparently he's on
the last flight to Miami...

231
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:30,237
...so you have all night
to question me.

232
00:39:33,078 --> 00:39:34,547
In that case...

233
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:35,877
...we're gonna need...

234
00:39:36,087 --> 00:39:38,448
...some more champagne.

235
00:39:44,357 --> 00:39:45,757
Good evening. Room Service.

236
00:39:45,958 --> 00:39:49,757
Good evening. Can I get a bottle
of chilled Bollinger Grand Année...

237
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:51,217
...and the beluga caviar?

238
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:53,868
- With everything?
- Yes, with everything.

239
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,158
- And would that be for two, sir?
- What?

240
00:39:56,368 --> 00:39:59,638
- For two?
- No, for one.

241
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:34,467
Wait here.

242
00:40:38,547 --> 00:40:41,708
There you go. Number 53.

243
00:40:45,687 --> 00:40:48,058
Dr. von Hagens' Body Worlds
invites visitors...

244
00:40:48,257 --> 00:40:51,087
...to observe the body's various
locomotive, digestive...

245
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:53,058
...nervous and vascular systems.

246
00:41:53,658 --> 00:41:57,058
Please may I have your attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

247
00:41:58,698 --> 00:42:01,958
I believe it is something very special,
what we see here.

248
00:42:02,167 --> 00:42:03,328
This is edutainment.

249
00:42:29,687 --> 00:42:31,848
...fixed in dramatic
and athletic poses...

250
00:42:32,098 --> 00:42:35,928
...that reveal the true-to-life spatial
relationships amongst organs.

251
00:42:50,078 --> 00:42:51,598
Hello.

252
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:53,717
Hello.

253
00:43:03,388 --> 00:43:05,888
Do not leave your vehicle unattended.

254
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:08,658
Welcome to Miami International Airport.

255
00:43:08,868 --> 00:43:11,987
Curbside parking in front
of the terminal is restricted...

256
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:49,987
- Yes.
- It's Bond. I need her now.

257
00:44:50,198 --> 00:44:52,948
I'm afraid she can't be disturbed.
Can I take a message?

258
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:56,524
Listen, you go and find her, tell her
to call Security at Miami Airport...

259
00:44:56,607 --> 00:44:59,357
...because I think a bomb is about
to go off. Do it now.

260
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:02,308
- Sorry, can I put you on hold?
- I thought you might.

261
00:45:06,748 --> 00:45:09,478
Bond? What the hell are you up to?

262
00:45:12,317 --> 00:45:13,317
I'll call you back.

263
00:45:36,107 --> 00:45:38,448
- The Skyfleet S570 prototype.
- What about it?

264
00:45:38,647 --> 00:45:42,397
"The largest airplane in the world will
be unveiled today at Miami Airport."

265
00:46:23,288 --> 00:46:24,317
Oh, my God!

266
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:26,118
Bond? Bond!

267
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:31,228
His target is the Skyfleet prototype.

268
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:33,368
It's launching today.

269
00:46:36,408 --> 00:46:37,567
I gotta go.

270
00:51:02,908 --> 00:51:04,638
Stop! Stop!

271
00:52:07,397 --> 00:52:09,397
Get moving!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

272
00:53:42,397 --> 00:53:47,167
The puts expired. I'm sorry,
I'm not sure yet how much you've lost.

273
00:53:47,368 --> 00:53:52,768
One hundred and one million,
two hundred and six thousand dollars.

274
00:53:59,317 --> 00:54:01,478
Someone talked.

275
00:54:25,308 --> 00:54:27,325
- You got everything you need?
- Yeah, I have.

276
00:54:27,408 --> 00:54:29,467
I'm gonna get a few more photos...

277
00:54:43,857 --> 00:54:46,888
Quite the body count you're stacking up.

278
00:54:47,698 --> 00:54:50,544
She was tortured first.
As you'd already killed her husband...

279
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:53,257
...she must have been
the only one left to question.

280
00:54:53,967 --> 00:54:56,185
Did she know anything
that could compromise you?

281
00:54:56,268 --> 00:54:57,268
No.

282
00:54:57,437 --> 00:55:00,897
- Not your name, what you were after?
- No.

283
00:55:01,107 --> 00:55:02,665
Dimitrios worked as a middleman.

284
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:04,625
Knew where to put his hands on weapons...

285
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:06,265
...and people who could use them.

286
00:55:06,348 --> 00:55:08,095
He worked with anyone who had money.

287
00:55:08,178 --> 00:55:11,547
For years he was involved with a man
we knew as Le Chiffre...

288
00:55:11,757 --> 00:55:13,774
...a private banker
to the world's terrorists.

289
00:55:13,857 --> 00:55:17,317
He invested their money, gave them
access to it wherever they wanted.

290
00:55:17,527 --> 00:55:19,288
Oh, good. You're here.

291
00:55:19,498 --> 00:55:22,058
Albanian, we believe.
Chess prodigy.

292
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:26,828
A bit of a mathematical genius
and liked to prove it by playing poker.

293
00:55:56,098 --> 00:55:57,587
So you can keep an eye on me?

294
00:55:58,937 --> 00:56:00,428
Yes.

295
00:56:05,337 --> 00:56:08,467
When they analyzed
the stock market after 9.11...

296
00:56:08,678 --> 00:56:11,978
...the CIA discovered a massive
shorting of airline stocks.

297
00:56:12,817 --> 00:56:16,007
When the stocks hit bottom on 9I12,
somebody made a fortune.

298
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:19,404
The same thing happened
this morning with Skyfleet stock...

299
00:56:19,487 --> 00:56:20,717
...or was supposed to.

300
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:24,687
With their prototype destroyed, the
company would be near bankruptcy.

301
00:56:24,888 --> 00:56:28,917
Instead, somebody lost over
$ 100 million betting the wrong way.

302
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,828
You think it's this man Le Chiffre.

303
00:56:32,038 --> 00:56:35,084
Which would explain how he could
set up a high-stakes poker game...

304
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:36,868
...at Casino Royale in Montenegro.

305
00:56:37,067 --> 00:56:41,127
Ten players, $ 10 million buy-in,
5 million re-buy.

306
00:56:41,337 --> 00:56:44,107
Winner takes all.
Potentially 150 million.

307
00:56:44,308 --> 00:56:46,868
Good.
Then we'll know where he'll be.

308
00:56:47,078 --> 00:56:49,165
Do you want a clean kill
or to send a message?

309
00:56:49,248 --> 00:56:53,518
We want him alive. Le Chiffre
doesn't have 100 million to lose.

310
00:56:53,717 --> 00:56:57,118
Has he been playing the stock market
with his clients' funds?

311
00:56:57,328 --> 00:57:00,274
They're not gonna be too happy
when they find out it's gone.

312
00:57:00,357 --> 00:57:01,845
We can't let him win this game.

313
00:57:01,928 --> 00:57:04,158
If he loses, he'll have nowhere to run.

314
00:57:04,368 --> 00:57:07,268
We'll give him sanctuary
in return for everything he knows.

315
00:57:07,397 --> 00:57:09,127
I'm putting you in the game...

316
00:57:09,337 --> 00:57:11,998
...replacing someone
who's playing for a syndicate.

317
00:57:12,208 --> 00:57:15,768
According to Villiers,
you're the best player in the Service.

318
00:57:16,178 --> 00:57:18,007
Trust me, I wish it wasn't the case.

319
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:26,987
I would ask you if you could remain
emotionally detached...

320
00:57:27,187 --> 00:57:30,348
...but I don't think
that's your problem, is it, Bond?

321
00:57:31,058 --> 00:57:32,888
No.

322
00:57:34,958 --> 00:57:36,708
Don't worry about keeping in touch.

323
00:57:37,828 --> 00:57:39,127
We'll know where you are.

324
00:57:39,337 --> 00:57:40,698
You can stop pretending.

325
00:57:41,567 --> 00:57:43,817
You knew I wouldn't let this drop,
didn't you?

326
00:57:44,768 --> 00:57:47,067
Well, I knew you were you.

327
00:58:05,627 --> 00:58:07,317
Thank you.

328
00:58:14,337 --> 00:58:15,698
I'm the money.

329
00:58:18,007 --> 00:58:19,268
Every penny of it.

330
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:24,108
The Treasury has agreed
to stake you in the game.

331
00:58:25,178 --> 00:58:26,837
"Vesper."

332
00:58:27,047 --> 00:58:29,597
Well, I do hope you gave
your parents hell for that.

333
00:58:30,317 --> 00:58:31,748
Thank you.

334
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,618
Your boss must be well-connected.

335
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:36,317
I've never seen so much
go out the door so quickly.

336
00:58:36,857 --> 00:58:38,487
Or quite so stylishly.

337
00:58:40,598 --> 00:58:42,027
May I ask you where it is?

338
00:58:42,228 --> 00:58:44,878
Ten million was wired
to your account in Montenegro...

339
00:58:44,967 --> 00:58:49,297
...with a contingency for 5 more
if I deem it a prudent investment.

340
00:58:49,507 --> 00:58:52,654
I suppose you've given some thought
to the notion that if you lose...

341
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,638
...our government
will have directly financed terrorism.

342
00:58:59,018 --> 00:59:00,408
What looks good?

343
00:59:07,658 --> 00:59:10,558
So you're telling me it's a matter
of probability and odds.

344
00:59:10,658 --> 00:59:12,745
I was worried there was
some chance involved.

345
00:59:12,828 --> 00:59:15,778
Well, only if you assume the player
with the best hand wins.

346
00:59:16,027 --> 00:59:18,127
So that would be what you call "bluffing"?

347
00:59:20,998 --> 00:59:22,797
You've heard the term.

348
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:25,625
Then you'll also know that in poker
you never play your hand.

349
00:59:25,708 --> 00:59:27,194
You play the man across from you.

350
00:59:27,277 --> 00:59:29,677
- And you're good at reading people?
- Yes, I am.

351
00:59:29,848 --> 00:59:31,665
Which is why I've been able to detect...

352
00:59:31,748 --> 00:59:33,898
...an undercurrent
of sarcasm in your voice.

353
00:59:34,578 --> 00:59:37,448
I'm now assured our money
is in good hands.

354
00:59:38,518 --> 00:59:40,834
You don't think
this is a very good plan, do you?

355
00:59:40,917 --> 00:59:42,408
So there is a plan?

356
00:59:42,627 --> 00:59:45,314
I got the impression
we were risking millions of dollars...

357
00:59:45,397 --> 00:59:47,627
...and hundreds of lives
on a game of luck.

358
00:59:47,828 --> 00:59:49,857
What else can you surmise,
Mr. Bond?

359
00:59:50,067 --> 00:59:52,228
About you, Miss Lynd?

360
00:59:52,437 --> 00:59:54,027
Well, your beauty's a problem.

361
00:59:54,498 --> 00:59:56,498
You worry you won't be taken seriously.

362
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:59,698
Which one can say of any
attractive woman with half a brain.

363
00:59:59,908 --> 01:00:01,595
True, but this one overcompensates...

364
01:00:01,678 --> 01:00:03,625
...by wearing
slightly masculine clothing...

365
01:00:03,708 --> 01:00:06,194
...being more aggressive
than her female colleagues...

366
01:00:06,277 --> 01:00:08,748
...which gives her a somewhat
prickly demeanor...

367
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:12,404
...and ironically enough, makes it
less likely for her to be accepted...

368
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:14,678
...and promoted
by her male superiors...

369
01:00:14,888 --> 01:00:17,658
...who mistake her insecurities
for arrogance.

370
01:00:18,158 --> 01:00:22,187
Now, I'd have normally
gone with only child...

371
01:00:22,397 --> 01:00:25,615
...but, you see, by the way you ignored
the quip about your parents...

372
01:00:25,698 --> 01:00:28,357
...I'm gonna have to go with orphan.

373
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:33,268
All right.

374
01:00:34,138 --> 01:00:36,825
By the cut of your suit,
you went to Oxford or wherever...

375
01:00:36,908 --> 01:00:39,395
...and actually think
human beings dress like that.

376
01:00:39,478 --> 01:00:41,377
But you wear it with such disdain...

377
01:00:41,578 --> 01:00:43,604
...my guess is
you didn't come from money...

378
01:00:43,687 --> 01:00:46,248
...and your school friends
never let you forget it.

379
01:00:46,458 --> 01:00:48,504
Which means you were
at that school by the grace...

380
01:00:48,587 --> 01:00:51,575
...of someone else's charity,
hence the chip on your shoulder.

381
01:00:51,658 --> 01:00:54,274
And since your first thought about me
ran to orphan...

382
01:00:54,357 --> 01:00:56,348
...that's what I'd say you are.

383
01:01:00,297 --> 01:01:02,288
Oh, you are.

384
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:04,598
I like this poker thing.

385
01:01:04,808 --> 01:01:06,567
And that makes perfect sense...

386
01:01:06,777 --> 01:01:09,178
...since MI6 looks
for maladjusted young men...

387
01:01:09,377 --> 01:01:11,765
...that give little thought
to sacrificing others...

388
01:01:11,848 --> 01:01:14,038
...in order to protect
Queen and country.

389
01:01:14,248 --> 01:01:15,337
You know...

390
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:19,487
...former SAS types with easy smiles
and expensive watches.

391
01:01:19,987 --> 01:01:22,357
- Rolex?
- Omega.

392
01:01:22,558 --> 01:01:24,388
Beautiful.

393
01:01:24,888 --> 01:01:26,558
Now, having just met you...

394
01:01:26,757 --> 01:01:29,714
...I wouldn't go as far as calling you
a cold-hearted bastard.

395
01:01:29,797 --> 01:01:31,158
No, of course not.

396
01:01:31,368 --> 01:01:33,185
But it wouldn't be a stretch to imagine.

397
01:01:33,268 --> 01:01:35,468
You think of women
as disposable pleasures...

398
01:01:35,638 --> 01:01:37,728
...rather than meaningful pursuits.

399
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:41,337
So as charming as you are,
Mr. Bond...

400
01:01:41,538 --> 01:01:44,095
...I will be keeping my eye
on our government's money...

401
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:46,147
...and off your perfectly formed arse.

402
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:48,138
You noticed?

403
01:01:48,348 --> 01:01:50,337
Even accountants have imagination.

404
01:01:50,547 --> 01:01:51,877
How was your lamb?

405
01:01:52,288 --> 01:01:53,848
Skewered.

406
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:55,678
One sympathizes.

407
01:01:57,527 --> 01:01:59,018
Good evening, Mr. Bond.

408
01:01:59,228 --> 01:02:01,558
Good evening, Miss Lynd.

409
01:02:17,078 --> 01:02:20,047
- Hotel Splendid, sir?
- That's right.

410
01:02:22,317 --> 01:02:24,547
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

411
01:02:38,067 --> 01:02:40,868
It's just last-minute details.

412
01:02:42,567 --> 01:02:44,317
Apparently we're very much in love.

413
01:02:45,038 --> 01:02:48,125
Do you usually leave it to porters
to tell you this sort of thing?

414
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:50,908
Only when the romance
has been necessarily brief.

415
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:54,277
I'm Mr. Arlington Beech,
professional gambler...

416
01:02:54,478 --> 01:02:56,165
...and you're
Miss Stephanie Broadchest...

417
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:58,564
- I am not.
- You're gonna have to trust me on this.

418
01:02:58,647 --> 01:03:00,618
Oh, no, I don't.

419
01:03:00,817 --> 01:03:02,817
We've been involved for quite a while...

420
01:03:03,317 --> 01:03:05,078
...hence the shared suite.

421
01:03:05,288 --> 01:03:07,658
But my family is strict Roman Catholic...

422
01:03:07,857 --> 01:03:10,705
...so for appearances' sake,
it'll be a two-bedroom suite.

423
01:03:10,788 --> 01:03:14,058
I do hate it when religion
comes between us.

424
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:16,757
Religion and a securely locked door.

425
01:03:16,967 --> 01:03:19,055
Am I going to have a problem
with you, Bond?

426
01:03:19,138 --> 01:03:21,897
No, don't worry. You're not my type.

427
01:03:22,138 --> 01:03:23,228
Smart?

428
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:25,538
Single.

429
01:03:44,757 --> 01:03:46,875
Welcome to the Hotel Splendid.
Your name, sir?

430
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:49,828
James Bond. You'll find
the reservation under Beech.

431
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,757
- Welcome, Mr. Bond.
- You sign that, dear.

432
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:55,737
You represent the Treasury.

433
01:04:00,078 --> 01:04:02,737
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

434
01:04:02,948 --> 01:04:04,538
I will. Thank you.

435
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:08,708
Very funny.

436
01:04:08,917 --> 01:04:11,004
Look, if Le Chiffre
is that well-connected...

437
01:04:11,087 --> 01:04:13,274
...he knows who I am
and where the money's from.

438
01:04:13,357 --> 01:04:15,587
Which means he's decided
to play me anyway.

439
01:04:15,788 --> 01:04:18,274
So he's either desperate
or he's overly confident...

440
01:04:18,357 --> 01:04:20,774
...but either way, that tells me
something about him.

441
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,388
And all he gets in return
is a name he already has.

442
01:04:23,698 --> 01:04:25,455
And now he knows something about you.

443
01:04:25,538 --> 01:04:27,728
He knows you're reckless.

444
01:04:28,337 --> 01:04:30,167
Take the next one.

445
01:04:30,368 --> 01:04:33,237
There isn't enough room for me
and your ego.

446
01:04:33,638 --> 01:04:35,198
Mr. Bond?

447
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:37,737
- It was left for you.
- Thank you.

448
01:05:08,877 --> 01:05:10,397
I love you too, M.

449
01:05:49,587 --> 01:05:54,788
My name is Mathis. Rene Mathis.
I'm your contact here.

450
01:05:58,297 --> 01:05:59,975
Does he know we've been watching him?

451
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:02,728
Le Chiffre? I don't think so.

452
01:06:02,928 --> 01:06:07,268
Probably because there's no "we."
Just me.

453
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,984
I'm afraid if you get into trouble here...

454
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:13,797
...the cavalry won't be
coming over the nearest hill.

455
01:06:15,348 --> 01:06:17,138
Le Chiffre arrived yesterday...

456
01:06:17,578 --> 01:06:21,107
...and spent the time reestablishing
old relationships.

457
01:06:21,717 --> 01:06:24,647
The chief of police and he
are now quite close.

458
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:26,757
That's him, with the mustache.

459
01:06:26,958 --> 01:06:28,518
Over my left shoulder.

460
01:06:29,587 --> 01:06:31,788
Well, that could make life
quite difficult.

461
01:06:31,998 --> 01:06:33,958
Yeah, and quite possibly shorter.

462
01:06:34,158 --> 01:06:36,788
He's not a very subtle man.

463
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:40,158
I thought about trying to buy
his services, but we frankly...

464
01:06:40,368 --> 01:06:43,567
...couldn't afford to outbid Le Chiffre.

465
01:06:51,678 --> 01:06:52,837
I hate to say it...

466
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:57,007
...but the accountants seem
to be running MI6 these days.

467
01:06:58,087 --> 01:07:01,288
Oh, not that I have anything
against accountants.

468
01:07:01,487 --> 01:07:03,757
Many of them are lovely people.

469
01:07:05,297 --> 01:07:08,388
So I decided that it was cheaper
to supply his deputy...

470
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:12,187
...with evidence
that we were bribing the chief.

471
01:07:12,397 --> 01:07:16,737
It's amazing what you can do with
Photoshop these days, isn't it?

472
01:07:19,678 --> 01:07:22,297
I think your odds are improving,
Mr. Bond.

473
01:07:27,777 --> 01:07:29,147
Yes?

474
01:07:29,817 --> 01:07:31,478
For you.

475
01:07:32,658 --> 01:07:35,147
Something you expect me to wear?

476
01:07:37,627 --> 01:07:39,027
I need you looking fabulous.

477
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:41,584
So when you walk up behind me
and kiss me on the neck...

478
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:44,145
...the players will be thinking
about your neckline...

479
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:45,958
...and not about their cards.

480
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:48,567
Do you think you can do that for me?

481
01:07:48,768 --> 01:07:50,708
I'll do my best.

482
01:07:51,777 --> 01:07:53,708
Thank you.

483
01:08:05,717 --> 01:08:06,948
I have a dinner jacket.

484
01:08:08,158 --> 01:08:10,487
There are dinner jackets
and dinner jackets.

485
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:11,848
This is the latter.

486
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:15,257
And I need you looking like a man
who belongs at that table.

487
01:08:15,698 --> 01:08:17,328
How...?

488
01:08:18,137 --> 01:08:19,597
It's tailored.

489
01:08:19,798 --> 01:08:22,357
I sized you up the moment we met.

490
01:09:16,057 --> 01:09:18,687
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

491
01:09:20,628 --> 01:09:22,288
Thank you.

492
01:09:33,078 --> 01:09:35,198
And you must be
Mr. Bliss' replacement.

493
01:09:35,408 --> 01:09:37,508
Welcome, Mr. Beech.

494
01:09:38,718 --> 01:09:41,508
Or is that Bond?
I'm a little confused.

495
01:09:41,718 --> 01:09:44,147
Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?

496
01:09:53,597 --> 01:09:55,588
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

497
01:09:55,798 --> 01:09:58,387
As you know, the game is no-limit
hold 'em poker.

498
01:09:58,597 --> 01:10:00,538
Five communal cards, two in the hole.

499
01:10:00,998 --> 01:10:03,885
Monsieur Mendel here represents
the Basel Bank, Switzerland...

500
01:10:03,968 --> 01:10:05,198
...holding the stakes.

501
01:10:07,508 --> 01:10:10,038
You have each deposited
$ 10 million buy-in.

502
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:13,264
A further buy-in of 5 million
can be made by electronic transfer.

503
01:10:13,347 --> 01:10:15,564
The money will remain in escrow
until I return...

504
01:10:15,647 --> 01:10:18,505
...and the winner of the contest
enters his or her password...

505
01:10:18,588 --> 01:10:19,788
...into the encryptor...

506
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:21,804
...whereupon the entire sum
will be wired...

507
01:10:21,887 --> 01:10:24,287
...to any bank account
in the world you nominate.

508
01:10:24,588 --> 01:10:26,317
Mr. Bond?

509
01:10:26,758 --> 01:10:28,045
We proceed alphabetically.

510
01:10:28,128 --> 01:10:30,878
Please be so kind as to enter
a password of your choice.

511
01:10:38,977 --> 01:10:40,137
Six letters or more.

512
01:10:53,218 --> 01:10:55,887
High card for dealer position.

513
01:11:02,927 --> 01:11:04,227
It's Signor Gallardo.

514
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:07,458
Mr. Kaminofsky is
the small blind, $5000...

515
01:11:07,668 --> 01:11:11,128
...and Mr. Fukutu, the big blind,
$ 10,000.

516
01:11:13,237 --> 01:11:15,267
Well, enjoy the game.

517
01:11:39,137 --> 01:11:40,227
Four players.

518
01:11:42,838 --> 01:11:44,168
It's your bet.

519
01:11:45,708 --> 01:11:47,177
Check.

520
01:11:47,378 --> 01:11:49,168
Check.

521
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,538
Bet. Fifty thousand.

522
01:12:08,767 --> 01:12:10,027
Call.

523
01:12:13,298 --> 01:12:14,567
Fold.

524
01:12:16,767 --> 01:12:19,168
Fold. Heads up.

525
01:12:23,477 --> 01:12:24,908
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

526
01:12:36,427 --> 01:12:38,987
Bet. One hundred thousand.

527
01:12:42,097 --> 01:12:45,088
Weren't you supposed to enter
so the others could see you?

528
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:48,328
Was I? Forgive me.

529
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:51,067
Good luck, darling.

530
01:12:54,878 --> 01:12:57,277
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

531
01:12:59,248 --> 01:13:00,437
Monsieur Bond?

532
01:13:00,647 --> 01:13:03,307
Oh, I'm sorry. What was the bet?
A hundred thousand?

533
01:13:04,118 --> 01:13:05,847
Call.

534
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:12,147
Hello.

535
01:13:12,357 --> 01:13:15,958
I suppose I don't have to tell you
how beautiful you look.

536
01:13:16,168 --> 01:13:19,288
Half the people at that table
are still watching you.

537
01:13:19,498 --> 01:13:20,498
Champagne.

538
01:13:24,168 --> 01:13:26,038
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

539
01:13:37,118 --> 01:13:38,418
Bet. Two hundred thousand.

540
01:13:44,828 --> 01:13:48,588
Monsieur, you have been called.
Showdown, please.

541
01:13:50,267 --> 01:13:53,427
A full house to Monsieur Le Chiffre.
Deuces full of nines.

542
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,427
Mr. Bond?

543
01:13:58,338 --> 01:13:59,668
Fold.

544
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:09,378
Send the barman over, please.

545
01:14:17,527 --> 01:14:20,328
A dry martini. Wait.

546
01:14:20,527 --> 01:14:22,344
Three measures Gordon's, one of vodka...

547
01:14:22,427 --> 01:14:24,385
...half of Kina Lillet,
shake it over ice...

548
01:14:24,468 --> 01:14:27,298
- ...then add a thin slice of lemon peel.
- Yes, sir.

549
01:14:27,498 --> 01:14:30,368
- You know, I'll have one of those.
- So will I.

550
01:14:31,338 --> 01:14:32,567
Certainly.

551
01:14:33,508 --> 01:14:37,408
My friend, bring me one as well.
Keep the fruit.

552
01:14:38,277 --> 01:14:39,607
That's it?

553
01:14:40,918 --> 01:14:42,508
Anyone want to play poker now?

554
01:14:42,718 --> 01:14:43,878
Someone's in a hurry.

555
01:14:52,897 --> 01:14:54,828
Would you excuse me?

556
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:09,677
You taste nice.

557
01:15:09,878 --> 01:15:12,807
- I thought we dispensed with covers.
- No.

558
01:15:13,017 --> 01:15:16,708
We dispensed with one that was
of no use and created another that is.

559
01:15:16,918 --> 01:15:18,437
- Is he watching?
- Yes.

560
01:15:18,658 --> 01:15:19,708
Good.

561
01:15:19,918 --> 01:15:22,804
This is me in character pissed off
because you're losing so fast...

562
01:15:22,887 --> 01:15:24,658
...we won't be here past midnight.

563
01:15:24,857 --> 01:15:27,828
Oddly, my character's feelings
mirror my own.

564
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:30,017
Check.

565
01:15:30,668 --> 01:15:32,615
- You know, that's not half bad.
- Up to you.

566
01:15:32,698 --> 01:15:34,798
I'm gonna have to think up
a name for that.

567
01:15:36,137 --> 01:15:38,698
It was worth it to discover his tell.

568
01:15:39,038 --> 01:15:40,298
What do you mean?

569
01:15:40,677 --> 01:15:42,727
The twitch he has to hide when he bluffs.

570
01:15:42,908 --> 01:15:47,038
- Bluffs? He had the best hand.
- Which he got on the last card.

571
01:15:47,248 --> 01:15:49,564
The odds against were 23-to-1,
and he'd know that.

572
01:15:49,647 --> 01:15:51,734
When he did his first raise
he had nothing.

573
01:15:51,817 --> 01:15:53,347
Winning was blind luck.

574
01:15:53,557 --> 01:15:55,387
- Did you get the bug?
- Yes.

575
01:15:55,588 --> 01:15:57,458
Bet. One hundred thousand.

576
01:15:57,658 --> 01:15:59,177
Thank you.

577
01:16:00,998 --> 01:16:02,545
It's your play, Monsieur Fukutu.

578
01:16:02,628 --> 01:16:05,658
Maybe he can actually pull this off.

579
01:16:06,498 --> 01:16:07,937
Call.

580
01:16:09,538 --> 01:16:11,508
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

581
01:16:14,038 --> 01:16:16,567
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mesdames, Messieurs...

582
01:16:16,777 --> 01:16:18,665
...we've now been
playing for four hours.

583
01:16:18,748 --> 01:16:23,208
It's time for a short break.
We will resume play in one hour.

584
01:16:52,048 --> 01:16:57,817
Well, I think I'll report
on the evening's frivolities.

585
01:16:59,418 --> 01:17:01,288
So?

586
01:17:01,487 --> 01:17:03,618
You want to do what to me?

587
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,158
You've lost me completely.

588
01:17:05,357 --> 01:17:08,557
You just said you can't wait
to get me back to the room. Come on.

589
01:17:32,258 --> 01:17:35,878
So, what's so damn important?

590
01:17:38,328 --> 01:17:39,918
I'm sorry.

591
01:17:42,798 --> 01:17:44,357
Where is my money?

592
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:50,224
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

593
01:17:50,307 --> 01:17:52,538
You're holding a parcel for me.

594
01:17:57,177 --> 01:17:58,838
Thank you.

595
01:18:00,118 --> 01:18:04,277
Do you think you can lose that kind
of money and no one would notice?

596
01:18:04,817 --> 01:18:06,618
Your money is safe.

597
01:18:08,418 --> 01:18:10,147
Open that.

598
01:18:26,177 --> 01:18:28,227
You'll have it tomorrow.

599
01:18:29,177 --> 01:18:30,477
All of it.

600
01:18:43,958 --> 01:18:47,918
I would take a hand for this betrayal,
but you need it to play cards.

601
01:18:52,468 --> 01:18:54,198
Hold out your arm.

602
01:18:55,468 --> 01:18:57,267
Hold out your arm, my beauty...

603
01:18:57,908 --> 01:18:59,498
...or I will take your head.

604
01:19:09,418 --> 01:19:12,347
Go to the room. Wait for me there.

605
01:19:25,698 --> 01:19:26,698
Stairs.

606
01:19:31,168 --> 01:19:33,798
Not a word of protest.

607
01:19:34,408 --> 01:19:36,968
You should find a new boyfriend.

608
01:21:39,137 --> 01:21:40,828
Go find Mathis.

609
01:21:41,038 --> 01:21:44,385
Tell him I've hidden the bodies here
and I want him to get rid of them.

610
01:21:44,468 --> 01:21:47,498
Do that now. Go. Go, go!

611
01:22:50,338 --> 01:22:52,927
You changed your shirt, Mr. Bond.

612
01:22:53,277 --> 01:22:56,968
I hope our little game
isn't causing you to perspire.

613
01:22:57,177 --> 01:22:58,408
A little.

614
01:22:58,607 --> 01:23:02,207
But I won't consider myself to be
in trouble until I start weeping blood.

615
01:23:02,387 --> 01:23:06,408
Ladies and gentlemen, if everybody's
ready, let's continue the game.

616
01:24:07,647 --> 01:24:12,017
It's like there's blood on my hands.
It's not coming off.

617
01:24:13,057 --> 01:24:14,918
Here, let's see.

618
01:24:30,508 --> 01:24:32,338
That's better.

619
01:24:36,408 --> 01:24:37,737
You cold?

620
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:39,347
Yeah.

621
01:24:39,548 --> 01:24:41,448
Here.

622
01:25:38,168 --> 01:25:40,437
You have any trouble with the bodies?

623
01:25:40,807 --> 01:25:42,937
Less than some.

624
01:25:56,727 --> 01:26:00,458
Being dead doesn't mean
one can't still be helpful.

625
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:04,088
That'll keep Le Chiffre
looking over his shoulder.

626
01:26:04,298 --> 01:26:06,698
He'll be wondering who's gonna
come for him next.

627
01:26:08,168 --> 01:26:10,397
How's our girl?

628
01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:14,137
Melted your cold heart yet?

629
01:26:32,057 --> 01:26:33,258
Call.

630
01:26:33,458 --> 01:26:34,857
Fold.

631
01:26:35,057 --> 01:26:37,027
And call.

632
01:26:38,328 --> 01:26:40,387
Three players.

633
01:26:44,008 --> 01:26:45,767
Three hundred grand.

634
01:26:45,977 --> 01:26:47,637
Bet. Three hundred thousand.

635
01:26:49,508 --> 01:26:51,168
Call.

636
01:26:52,918 --> 01:26:53,918
And call.

637
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:00,347
Three players.

638
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:05,687
Check.

639
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:12,357
Monsieur Bond?

640
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:24,677
Bet. Five hundred thousand.

641
01:27:36,357 --> 01:27:40,658
Look. It's the tell. He is bluffing.

642
01:27:40,857 --> 01:27:42,887
My God, James was right.

643
01:27:43,998 --> 01:27:45,927
It's up to you.

644
01:27:52,067 --> 01:27:54,468
Raise. One million.

645
01:28:01,548 --> 01:28:03,918
Seems someone knows something I don't.

646
01:28:04,948 --> 01:28:06,147
Fold.

647
01:28:06,357 --> 01:28:08,118
Heads up, gentlemen.

648
01:28:08,317 --> 01:28:09,878
It's up to you.

649
01:28:24,067 --> 01:28:25,538
Two.

650
01:28:26,307 --> 01:28:28,397
Re-raise. Two million.

651
01:28:30,378 --> 01:28:32,437
And it's up to you.

652
01:28:43,527 --> 01:28:45,387
I'm all in.

653
01:28:52,798 --> 01:28:55,168
Well, it's 14 million and 500,000.

654
01:28:55,368 --> 01:28:57,698
It's up to you, Monsieur Bond.

655
01:29:00,338 --> 01:29:04,708
Bond will have to go all in
to call his bluff.

656
01:29:05,647 --> 01:29:08,378
- Call.
- Call.

657
01:29:08,817 --> 01:29:11,177
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

658
01:29:12,918 --> 01:29:15,317
Full house. Kings and aces.

659
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:17,548
Monsieur Le Chiffre.

660
01:29:30,508 --> 01:29:34,198
It's four jacks.
Monsieur Le Chiffre wins.

661
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:41,378
You must have thought
I was bluffing, Mr. Bond.

662
01:29:42,048 --> 01:29:43,208
Please.

663
01:29:43,418 --> 01:29:45,718
We will now break for one hour.

664
01:29:45,918 --> 01:29:49,248
When we return,
the big blind will be 200,000.

665
01:29:56,698 --> 01:29:58,357
Good game.

666
01:30:26,498 --> 01:30:29,828
Well, I'm gonna need the other
5 million to buy back in.

667
01:30:30,397 --> 01:30:32,727
I can't do that, James.

668
01:30:33,267 --> 01:30:35,668
Look, I made a mistake.

669
01:30:36,468 --> 01:30:39,458
I was impatient, maybe I was arrogant,
but I can beat him.

670
01:30:39,677 --> 01:30:41,107
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

671
01:30:42,177 --> 01:30:43,607
Sorry?

672
01:30:43,807 --> 01:30:45,578
Try putting that in a sentence.

673
01:30:45,777 --> 01:30:47,295
"Sorry Le Chiffre's gonna win...

674
01:30:47,378 --> 01:30:49,835
...continue funding terror and killing."
That kind of sorry?

675
01:30:49,918 --> 01:30:52,977
You lost because of your ego,
and that same ego can't take it.

676
01:30:53,187 --> 01:30:54,588
That's what this is about.

677
01:30:54,788 --> 01:30:56,788
All you're going to do now is lose more.

678
01:30:57,387 --> 01:30:58,548
Then you're an idiot.

679
01:30:58,758 --> 01:31:01,628
- I'm sorry?
- I said, you're a bloody idiot.

680
01:31:03,527 --> 01:31:05,798
Look in my eyes.

681
01:31:06,567 --> 01:31:08,328
I can beat this man, you know that.

682
01:31:10,968 --> 01:31:13,567
Get your hand off my arm.

683
01:31:36,468 --> 01:31:37,628
Vodka martini.

684
01:31:37,828 --> 01:31:40,628
- Shaken or stirred?
- Do I look like I give a damn?

685
01:31:58,817 --> 01:32:01,088
- James.
- Get the girl out.

686
01:32:08,357 --> 01:32:09,357
Funny game, right?

687
01:32:09,527 --> 01:32:12,628
Sorry, I should've introduced myself,
seeing as we're related.

688
01:32:13,368 --> 01:32:16,458
Felix Leiter, a brother from Langley.

689
01:32:18,468 --> 01:32:19,995
You should have a little faith.

690
01:32:20,078 --> 01:32:22,694
If you keep your head about you,
I think you have him.

691
01:32:22,777 --> 01:32:25,038
Had. Excuse me.

692
01:32:25,477 --> 01:32:27,408
You're not buying in?

693
01:32:29,118 --> 01:32:30,477
No.

694
01:32:33,817 --> 01:32:37,758
Listen, I'm bleeding chips.
I'm not gonna last much longer.

695
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:40,618
You have a better chance.
I'll stake you.

696
01:32:41,698 --> 01:32:43,915
I'm saying I'll give you the money
to keep going.

697
01:32:43,998 --> 01:32:48,868
Just one thing. If you pull it off,
the CIA bring him in.

698
01:32:50,237 --> 01:32:52,567
And what about the winnings?

699
01:32:53,277 --> 01:32:55,838
Does it look like we need the money?

700
01:33:07,387 --> 01:33:09,477
Shall we up the blinds?

701
01:33:11,687 --> 01:33:13,387
Why not?

702
01:33:16,868 --> 01:33:18,357
Bet.

703
01:33:20,437 --> 01:33:22,097
Raise.

704
01:33:37,618 --> 01:33:39,548
And fold.

705
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:43,758
Excuse me, please.

706
01:33:45,458 --> 01:33:47,088
Call.

707
01:33:48,557 --> 01:33:49,788
Raise.

708
01:33:49,998 --> 01:33:53,458
Raise. Five hundred thousand.

709
01:33:55,968 --> 01:33:57,908
- Fold.
- Thank you.

710
01:34:00,277 --> 01:34:01,437
Fold.

711
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:07,237
Fold.

712
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:13,588
Thank you.

713
01:34:13,788 --> 01:34:14,788
Wins.

714
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:37,038
Deal me out.

715
01:34:38,048 --> 01:34:41,168
Sorry, sir. You are the big blind.

716
01:34:43,147 --> 01:34:44,708
Small blind, please.

717
01:35:48,817 --> 01:35:51,218
- Who is it?
- It's 007.

718
01:35:52,887 --> 01:35:55,487
Bond's been poisoned.
He's going into cardiac arrest.

719
01:35:57,628 --> 01:36:00,175
Stay calm and don't interrupt.
Because you'll be dead...

720
01:36:00,258 --> 01:36:03,115
...within two minutes
unless you do exactly what I tell you.

721
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:04,357
I'm all ears.

722
01:36:04,567 --> 01:36:06,215
Remove the defibrillator from the pouch.

723
01:36:06,298 --> 01:36:08,848
- Do we know what it is yet?
- We're still scanning.

724
01:36:14,277 --> 01:36:17,008
Attach the leads to your chest.

725
01:36:25,647 --> 01:36:27,618
Ventricular tachycardia. Digitalis.

726
01:36:27,918 --> 01:36:30,844
What do we give him? The kit
has amphetamines, antihistamines...

727
01:36:30,927 --> 01:36:32,548
...hydrocortisone. Adrenalin?

728
01:36:32,758 --> 01:36:35,615
- As soon as it reads charged...
- Lidocaine. That'll work.

729
01:36:35,698 --> 01:36:38,285
Bond, don't push the red button yet.
Do you hear me? Don't push it.

730
01:36:38,368 --> 01:36:39,798
His heart's gonna stop.

731
01:36:39,998 --> 01:36:42,648
There's only time for one charge
before he passes out.

732
01:36:43,368 --> 01:36:47,237
Take the blue combipen, Bond.
Mid-neck into the vein.

733
01:36:47,437 --> 01:36:49,737
That'll counteract the digitalis.

734
01:36:53,048 --> 01:36:54,965
You're going to pass out in a few seconds.

735
01:36:55,048 --> 01:36:56,604
You need to keep your heart going.

736
01:36:56,687 --> 01:36:58,187
Push the red button now, Bond.

737
01:37:04,027 --> 01:37:06,458
- Bond, push the damn button!
- Do it now!

738
01:37:54,338 --> 01:37:56,307
- You okay?
- Me?

739
01:37:59,647 --> 01:38:02,237
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

740
01:38:02,448 --> 01:38:06,107
- Now get yourself off to a hospital.
- I will do.

741
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:08,618
As soon as I've won this game.

742
01:38:08,718 --> 01:38:11,448
You're not seriously going back there?

743
01:38:14,027 --> 01:38:15,927
I wouldn't dream of it.

744
01:38:17,567 --> 01:38:19,158
Bet. One million.

745
01:38:22,897 --> 01:38:24,458
- All in.
- Call. All in.

746
01:38:24,668 --> 01:38:27,267
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

747
01:38:29,277 --> 01:38:31,177
Two pair. Aces and sevens.

748
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:37,548
Queen plays. Wins.

749
01:38:46,128 --> 01:38:47,317
Oh, I'm sorry.

750
01:38:47,527 --> 01:38:50,088
That last hand, it nearly killed me.

751
01:38:51,527 --> 01:38:55,227
Gentlemen, with this chip exchange,
we enter the final phase of the game...

752
01:38:55,338 --> 01:38:57,097
...which means no more buy-ins.

753
01:38:57,307 --> 01:39:00,498
The big blind is now 1 million dollars.

754
01:39:07,578 --> 01:39:08,708
Four players.

755
01:39:11,517 --> 01:39:12,878
It's your bet.

756
01:39:16,927 --> 01:39:18,127
- Monsieur Bond?
- Check.

757
01:39:18,288 --> 01:39:22,128
- Check.
- Twenty-four million in the pot already.

758
01:39:24,998 --> 01:39:27,128
Check. And check.

759
01:39:27,567 --> 01:39:29,158
All check.

760
01:39:29,498 --> 01:39:30,698
Four players.

761
01:39:35,708 --> 01:39:37,107
- Check.
- Check.

762
01:39:43,017 --> 01:39:45,177
All in. Six million.

763
01:39:46,088 --> 01:39:48,607
Bet. Six million. All in.

764
01:39:54,057 --> 01:39:56,387
Five million. All in.

765
01:39:56,597 --> 01:39:59,158
Bet is 6 million.

766
01:40:06,677 --> 01:40:08,008
Raise.

767
01:40:09,578 --> 01:40:10,767
Raise.

768
01:40:10,977 --> 01:40:14,237
Twelve million. Heads up.

769
01:40:44,847 --> 01:40:47,968
Forty million, 500,000. All in.

770
01:40:50,418 --> 01:40:52,248
Raise. All in.

771
01:41:11,137 --> 01:41:14,727
Well, I think I will call you on that one.

772
01:41:21,578 --> 01:41:22,777
Call.

773
01:41:34,658 --> 01:41:38,857
One hundred and fifteen million
in the pot.

774
01:41:39,067 --> 01:41:41,798
Gentlemen, showdown, please.

775
01:41:45,437 --> 01:41:47,368
Flush. Ace, king, queen.

776
01:41:55,948 --> 01:41:58,937
Full house. Eights full of aces.

777
01:42:17,107 --> 01:42:19,227
A higher full house.

778
01:42:19,437 --> 01:42:20,908
Aces full of sixes.

779
01:42:26,918 --> 01:42:28,107
Monsieur Bond.

780
01:42:45,168 --> 01:42:47,658
Five and seven of spades.

781
01:42:47,868 --> 01:42:49,338
A straight flush.

782
01:42:49,538 --> 01:42:50,828
Four to the eight.

783
01:42:51,038 --> 01:42:53,128
The high hand.

784
01:42:57,847 --> 01:42:59,368
Monsieur Bond wins.

785
01:43:00,378 --> 01:43:02,677
- For you.
- Thank you very much.

786
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:06,307
Congratulations.

787
01:43:06,517 --> 01:43:10,048
- He's all yours.
- Much appreciated, brother.

788
01:43:17,027 --> 01:43:18,187
Congratulations.

789
01:43:18,397 --> 01:43:20,385
You know,
I think a celebration's in order.

790
01:43:20,468 --> 01:43:22,987
You were almost dead an hour ago.

791
01:43:23,868 --> 01:43:26,857
Come on, I'm famished.

792
01:43:37,288 --> 01:43:39,147
Thank you.

793
01:43:46,758 --> 01:43:50,658
Mathis says the Americans
have made contact with Le Chiffre.

794
01:43:50,868 --> 01:43:53,487
They're going to extract him before dawn.

795
01:43:54,198 --> 01:43:56,298
You know, I think I'll call that a Vesper.

796
01:43:57,567 --> 01:43:59,368
Because of the bitter aftertaste?

797
01:43:59,567 --> 01:44:03,737
No. Because once you've tasted it,
that's all you want to drink.

798
01:44:06,347 --> 01:44:09,597
- I thought that was quite a good line.
- It was a very good line.

799
01:44:10,687 --> 01:44:12,177
But you're laughing at it.

800
01:44:12,517 --> 01:44:16,788
- Not so much it as you.
- Well, that's fine then.

801
01:44:23,097 --> 01:44:24,658
I figured out what that is.

802
01:44:27,097 --> 01:44:29,368
It's an Algerian love knot.

803
01:44:29,567 --> 01:44:32,767
Really? I thought it was
just something pretty.

804
01:44:32,968 --> 01:44:34,597
No, you didn't.

805
01:44:35,508 --> 01:44:36,977
Someone gave that to you.

806
01:44:40,677 --> 01:44:42,408
He's a very lucky man.

807
01:44:48,918 --> 01:44:51,758
You can switch off so easily, can't you?

808
01:44:52,128 --> 01:44:54,317
It doesn't bother you,
killing those people?

809
01:44:54,927 --> 01:44:57,958
Well, I wouldn't be very good
at my job if it did.

810
01:44:58,897 --> 01:45:01,128
I don't believe you.

811
01:45:01,767 --> 01:45:03,927
You've got a choice, you know?

812
01:45:04,137 --> 01:45:05,854
Just because you've done something...

813
01:45:05,937 --> 01:45:08,067
...doesn't mean
you have to keep doing it.

814
01:45:08,277 --> 01:45:11,295
Why is it people who can't take advice
always insist on giving it?

815
01:45:11,378 --> 01:45:13,347
You think I can't take my own advice?

816
01:45:14,248 --> 01:45:16,908
I think something is driving you.

817
01:45:17,448 --> 01:45:19,648
And I think I'll never find out
what that is.

818
01:45:25,427 --> 01:45:27,548
Mathis needs me.

819
01:45:28,227 --> 01:45:29,487
Good night.

820
01:45:29,698 --> 01:45:31,027
Congratulations again.

821
01:45:50,317 --> 01:45:52,147
Mathis.

822
01:47:44,097 --> 01:47:48,027
I'm afraid your friend Mathis is really...

823
01:47:49,298 --> 01:47:51,097
...my friend Mathis.

824
01:49:33,878 --> 01:49:36,607
You've taken good care of your body.

825
01:49:43,147 --> 01:49:45,637
Such a waste.

826
01:50:02,897 --> 01:50:04,737
You know...

827
01:50:05,107 --> 01:50:08,227
...I never understood
all these elaborate tortures.

828
01:50:08,437 --> 01:50:10,637
It's the simplest thing...

829
01:50:10,847 --> 01:50:14,368
...to cause more pain
than a man can possibly endure.

830
01:50:15,878 --> 01:50:17,038
And of course...

831
01:50:17,248 --> 01:50:20,218
...it's not only the immediate agony,
but the knowledge...

832
01:50:20,418 --> 01:50:23,078
...that if you do not yield
soon enough...

833
01:50:23,788 --> 01:50:27,418
...there will be little left
to identify you as a man.

834
01:50:33,498 --> 01:50:35,397
The only question remains...

835
01:50:36,897 --> 01:50:39,067
...will you yield in time?

836
01:50:41,137 --> 01:50:44,267
I want the money.

837
01:51:02,998 --> 01:51:06,427
Miss Lynd will give me the account
number, if she hasn't already.

838
01:51:06,628 --> 01:51:08,998
So all I need from you is the password.

839
01:51:18,777 --> 01:51:22,008
The password, please.

840
01:51:26,248 --> 01:51:28,548
I've got a little itch...

841
01:51:28,758 --> 01:51:30,618
...down there.

842
01:51:31,387 --> 01:51:32,857
Would you mind?

843
01:51:40,597 --> 01:51:43,998
No! No! No!

844
01:51:44,968 --> 01:51:48,668
No. To the right.
To the right. To the right!

845
01:51:48,878 --> 01:51:51,307
You are a funny man, Mr. Bond.

846
01:51:53,248 --> 01:51:54,737
Yeah!

847
01:51:55,977 --> 01:51:59,277
Yes, yes, yes.

848
01:52:04,958 --> 01:52:10,397
Now the whole world's gonna know
that you died scratching my balls.

849
01:52:11,698 --> 01:52:13,687
I died?

850
01:52:13,897 --> 01:52:15,198
- I died?
- Yes.

851
01:52:15,397 --> 01:52:18,484
Because no matter what you do,
I'm not gonna give you the password.

852
01:52:18,567 --> 01:52:20,524
Which means your clients
will hunt you down...

853
01:52:20,607 --> 01:52:23,554
...and cut you into pieces of meat
while you're still breathing.

854
01:52:23,637 --> 01:52:25,038
Because if you kill me...

855
01:52:25,248 --> 01:52:27,307
...there'll be nowhere else to hide.

856
01:52:27,517 --> 01:52:30,307
But you are so wrong!

857
01:52:30,517 --> 01:52:33,635
Because even after I slaughtered
you and your little girlfriend...

858
01:52:33,718 --> 01:52:36,517
...your people would still welcome me
with open arms...

859
01:52:38,057 --> 01:52:41,687
...because they need what I know.

860
01:52:42,927 --> 01:52:44,987
The big picture.

861
01:52:52,908 --> 01:52:55,137
Give me the password...

862
01:52:55,338 --> 01:52:57,277
...and I will at least let her live.

863
01:53:00,948 --> 01:53:04,038
Bond. Do it soon enough
and she might even be in one piece.

864
01:53:17,128 --> 01:53:19,278
You really aren't going to tell me,
are you?

865
01:53:19,468 --> 01:53:21,258
No.

866
01:53:23,097 --> 01:53:24,998
So I think...

867
01:53:29,538 --> 01:53:32,977
...I'll feed you
what you seem not to value.

868
01:53:46,128 --> 01:53:48,387
I'll get the money.

869
01:53:49,298 --> 01:53:51,788
Tell them I'll get the money.

870
01:53:51,998 --> 01:53:56,458
Money isn't as valuable to our
organization as knowing who to trust.

871
01:54:20,088 --> 01:54:21,487
Francesco.

872
01:54:22,427 --> 01:54:24,328
Francesco.

873
01:54:37,038 --> 01:54:39,168
Vesper.

874
01:54:41,048 --> 01:54:42,948
Vesper.

875
01:54:45,088 --> 01:54:46,607
No.

876
01:54:47,418 --> 01:54:48,748
Not him.

877
01:54:48,958 --> 01:54:50,857
Not Mathis.

878
01:54:52,687 --> 01:54:53,847
No.

879
01:54:54,698 --> 01:54:56,718
I'll get the doctor.

880
01:54:59,498 --> 01:55:01,298
Not him.

881
01:55:03,198 --> 01:55:04,357
Any ideas?

882
01:55:08,107 --> 01:55:11,937
- What?
- Why they left the two of you alive.

883
01:55:13,948 --> 01:55:15,378
Where is she?

884
01:55:16,418 --> 01:55:18,317
Sleeping.

885
01:55:18,918 --> 01:55:22,177
Well, I'm supposed
to get you to drink this.

886
01:55:23,288 --> 01:55:24,948
It's just odd...

887
01:55:25,158 --> 01:55:29,057
...killing everyone else
but leaving you and her untouched.

888
01:55:29,258 --> 01:55:32,597
Almost as if someone
was trying to tell us something.

889
01:55:33,767 --> 01:55:35,887
Get a look at the killer?

890
01:55:36,437 --> 01:55:38,168
No.

891
01:55:39,637 --> 01:55:41,067
Shame.

892
01:55:42,737 --> 01:55:44,468
Drink up.

893
01:55:47,878 --> 01:55:50,038
Anything else you remember?

894
01:55:50,248 --> 01:55:52,277
Anything that can help us?

895
01:55:52,487 --> 01:55:54,107
Help us?

896
01:55:54,317 --> 01:55:56,548
Or help you?

897
01:56:36,927 --> 01:56:38,088
Hello.

898
01:56:38,298 --> 01:56:40,128
Hello.

899
01:56:41,838 --> 01:56:43,128
You all right?

900
01:56:43,767 --> 01:56:45,927
I can't resist waking you.

901
01:56:46,137 --> 01:56:50,767
Every time I do, you look at me as if
you haven't seen me in years.

902
01:56:51,908 --> 01:56:53,897
It makes me feel reborn.

903
01:56:57,647 --> 01:57:00,748
If you'd just been born...

904
01:57:01,418 --> 01:57:03,687
...wouldn't you be naked?

905
01:57:04,458 --> 01:57:06,647
You have me there.

906
01:57:09,328 --> 01:57:12,027
You can have me anywhere.

907
01:57:14,097 --> 01:57:15,628
I can?

908
01:57:15,838 --> 01:57:19,698
Yeah. Here, there,
anywhere you like.

909
01:57:20,708 --> 01:57:23,607
Does this mean that you're warming to me?

910
01:57:23,807 --> 01:57:26,008
Yeah. That's how I would describe it.

911
01:57:26,208 --> 01:57:27,764
It's just that not so long ago...

912
01:57:27,847 --> 01:57:31,718
...I would have described
your feelings towards me as...

913
01:57:33,187 --> 01:57:35,817
I'm trying to think
of a better word than "loathing."

914
01:57:36,387 --> 01:57:39,288
I'm afraid I'm a complicated woman.

915
01:57:39,828 --> 01:57:42,317
That is something to be afraid of.

916
01:57:45,097 --> 01:57:48,727
- Hello.
- Oh, perfect timing.

917
01:57:50,168 --> 01:57:52,897
Monsieur Mendel.
How are things in Switzerland?

918
01:57:53,107 --> 01:57:55,097
My apologies, I do not mean to rush...

919
01:57:55,307 --> 01:57:57,407
...but 120 million
is a large sum of money.

920
01:57:57,508 --> 01:58:00,358
It certainly is. You didn't bring
any chocolates with you?

921
01:58:00,548 --> 01:58:02,668
I'm afraid not.

922
01:58:03,878 --> 01:58:06,748
If you would type in the account number.

923
01:58:13,828 --> 01:58:15,227
And now the password.

924
01:58:16,027 --> 01:58:17,187
You can do that.

925
01:58:17,897 --> 01:58:19,958
I would if I knew what it was.

926
01:58:20,567 --> 01:58:22,567
V-E-S-P-E-R.

927
01:58:37,788 --> 01:58:39,578
The funds have been transferred.

928
01:58:39,788 --> 01:58:42,647
Sorry for disturbing you.

929
01:58:44,487 --> 01:58:47,718
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen, Herr Mendel.

930
01:58:54,298 --> 01:58:55,698
You know, James...

931
01:58:58,307 --> 01:59:01,325
...I just want you to know
that if all that was left of you...

932
01:59:01,408 --> 01:59:04,708
...was your smile
and your little finger...

933
01:59:04,908 --> 01:59:07,758
...you'd still be more of a man
than anyone I've ever met.

934
01:59:17,057 --> 01:59:20,718
That's because you know
what I can do with my little finger.

935
01:59:23,597 --> 01:59:27,468
- I have no idea.
- But you're aching to find out.

936
01:59:30,737 --> 01:59:34,668
You're not going to let me
in there, are you?

937
01:59:35,408 --> 01:59:37,538
You've got your armor back on.

938
01:59:37,737 --> 01:59:38,968
That's that.

939
01:59:40,477 --> 01:59:43,038
I have no armor left.

940
01:59:44,277 --> 01:59:46,777
You've stripped it from me.

941
01:59:47,647 --> 01:59:50,118
Whatever is left of me...

942
01:59:50,588 --> 01:59:53,458
Whatever is left of me...

943
01:59:54,288 --> 01:59:56,258
...whatever I am...

944
01:59:56,458 --> 01:59:58,948
...I'm yours.

945
02:01:00,387 --> 02:01:03,387
I suppose M won't miss me
for a couple of days.

946
02:01:04,128 --> 02:01:05,958
She'll be too busy sweating Mathis.

947
02:01:06,168 --> 02:01:07,357
Mathis?

948
02:01:07,567 --> 02:01:09,715
Remember I told you
about Le Chiffre's tell?

949
02:01:09,798 --> 02:01:12,237
Well, Mathis told Le Chiffre.

950
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:14,357
That's how he wiped me out.

951
02:01:14,578 --> 02:01:18,237
Same goes for the implant. Can't say
I'm too sorry about losing that.

952
02:01:18,448 --> 02:01:20,637
I can't believe it.

953
02:01:20,847 --> 02:01:22,437
No, neither could I.

954
02:01:22,918 --> 02:01:25,317
I thought he had my back.

955
02:01:25,987 --> 02:01:27,777
But there you go, lesson learned.

956
02:01:29,187 --> 02:01:31,588
Does everyone have a tell?

957
02:01:33,527 --> 02:01:35,258
Yes.

958
02:01:38,198 --> 02:01:39,958
Everyone.

959
02:01:40,368 --> 02:01:42,198
Everyone except you.

960
02:01:46,668 --> 02:01:48,698
I wonder if that's why I love you.

961
02:01:50,737 --> 02:01:52,677
You love me?

962
02:01:53,208 --> 02:01:55,594
Enough to quit
and float round the world with you...

963
02:01:55,677 --> 02:01:57,878
...until one of us
has to find an honest job.

964
02:01:58,517 --> 02:02:02,578
But I think that's gonna have to be you.
I've no idea what an honest job is.

965
02:02:03,487 --> 02:02:04,918
You're serious.

966
02:02:05,887 --> 02:02:07,788
Like you said...

967
02:02:08,357 --> 02:02:10,107
...you do what I do for too long...

968
02:02:10,258 --> 02:02:13,057
...and there won't be any soul
left to salvage.

969
02:02:13,267 --> 02:02:16,128
I'm leaving with what little I have left.

970
02:02:18,137 --> 02:02:20,227
Is that enough for you?

971
02:04:04,578 --> 02:04:06,477
- Come on.
- No. No.

972
02:04:06,977 --> 02:04:10,177
No, stop it. Stop.
I have to get to the bank.

973
02:04:10,378 --> 02:04:12,578
What's the time?

974
02:04:14,817 --> 02:04:16,878
How much do we need to float for a month?

975
02:04:17,357 --> 02:04:19,118
I've got plenty.

976
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:23,258
No, I want to pay for my half
of our aimless wanderings.

977
02:04:26,198 --> 02:04:28,527
You stopped wearing the necklace.

978
02:04:28,737 --> 02:04:31,897
Yeah. It was time.

979
02:04:32,107 --> 02:04:34,838
Time enough to get over someone?

980
02:04:39,607 --> 02:04:42,977
To realize sometimes
you can forget the past.

981
02:04:51,687 --> 02:04:53,588
Though apparently not your employer.

982
02:04:58,027 --> 02:05:01,258
Back in one month.

983
02:05:02,338 --> 02:05:04,737
Come on. I'll get the money...

984
02:05:04,937 --> 02:05:07,097
...you get supplies.

985
02:05:36,767 --> 02:05:39,198
I'll see you back here in half an hour.

986
02:06:03,698 --> 02:06:06,128
- Hello, M.
- I got your note.

987
02:06:06,328 --> 02:06:07,987
Yes?

988
02:06:08,198 --> 02:06:10,027
We'll talk about that later.

989
02:06:10,237 --> 02:06:13,227
Right now I have a lovely man
from the Treasury here...

990
02:06:13,437 --> 02:06:16,287
...wondering if you're ever
going to deposit the winnings.

991
02:06:19,708 --> 02:06:22,548
That's a shame.
I didn't think they'd miss it.

992
02:06:22,748 --> 02:06:26,048
Yes. Well, I told them not to worry.

993
02:06:26,248 --> 02:06:28,408
So you'll be depositing it today.

994
02:06:28,758 --> 02:06:31,378
On my way to the bank right now.

995
02:06:31,788 --> 02:06:34,487
James Bond for Mr. Mendel.

996
02:06:34,958 --> 02:06:36,118
Hello.

997
02:06:36,328 --> 02:06:37,428
Mr. Mendel?

998
02:06:37,579 --> 02:06:39,844
I'm having trouble accessing
the funds in my account.

999
02:06:39,927 --> 02:06:41,885
It was transferred
to the account number...

1000
02:06:41,968 --> 02:06:44,267
...your company gave us, Mr. Bond.

1001
02:06:46,908 --> 02:06:50,307
It appears the funds
are being withdrawn as we speak.

1002
02:06:53,008 --> 02:06:54,958
- Where?
- The Venice branch, of course.

1003
02:06:55,048 --> 02:06:56,277
St. Mark's Square.

1004
02:06:58,647 --> 02:07:00,347
Is there a problem, Mr. Bond?

1005
02:09:13,048 --> 02:09:14,208
I'll kill her!

1006
02:09:15,218 --> 02:09:16,418
Allow me.

1007
02:13:36,347 --> 02:13:38,317
I'm sorry, James.

1008
02:16:49,978 --> 02:16:52,708
She had a boyfriend.
A French Algerian.

1009
02:16:52,907 --> 02:16:54,968
They were very much in love.

1010
02:16:55,378 --> 02:16:58,507
He was kidnapped
by the organization behind Le Chiffre.

1011
02:16:58,718 --> 02:17:03,677
And they blackmailed her, threatening
to kill him unless she cooperated.

1012
02:17:03,888 --> 02:17:05,375
We should've picked up on it...

1013
02:17:05,458 --> 02:17:07,805
...but sometimes
we're so focused on our enemies...

1014
02:17:07,888 --> 02:17:09,588
...we forget to watch our friends.

1015
02:17:11,058 --> 02:17:12,927
How are you doing?

1016
02:17:13,267 --> 02:17:15,497
She left her cell phone.

1017
02:17:15,698 --> 02:17:18,068
She must have known I'd check it.

1018
02:17:18,868 --> 02:17:21,027
She knew you were you.

1019
02:17:22,107 --> 02:17:24,337
- Well, at least this clears Mathis.
- No.

1020
02:17:24,538 --> 02:17:26,167
- No?
- No.

1021
02:17:26,378 --> 02:17:28,994
We just proved that she's guilty,
not that he's innocent.

1022
02:17:29,077 --> 02:17:31,577
It could've been a double blind.
Keep sweating him.

1023
02:17:32,218 --> 02:17:34,104
You don't trust anyone, do you, James?

1024
02:17:34,187 --> 02:17:35,808
No.

1025
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:38,587
Then you've learnt your lesson.

1026
02:17:39,388 --> 02:17:41,587
Get back as soon as you can.
We need you.

1027
02:17:42,327 --> 02:17:43,488
Will do.

1028
02:17:45,767 --> 02:17:47,128
If you do need time...

1029
02:17:47,327 --> 02:17:48,727
Why should I need more time?

1030
02:17:49,738 --> 02:17:52,997
The job's done, and the bitch is dead.

1031
02:17:53,937 --> 02:17:55,738
James...

1032
02:17:56,378 --> 02:17:59,777
...did you ever ask yourself
why you weren't killed that night?

1033
02:18:00,378 --> 02:18:02,068
Isn't it obvious?

1034
02:18:02,277 --> 02:18:06,238
She made a deal to spare your life
in exchange for the money.

1035
02:18:06,448 --> 02:18:08,607
I'm sure she hoped
they would let her live.

1036
02:18:10,187 --> 02:18:13,177
But she must have known
she was going to her death.

1037
02:18:14,288 --> 02:18:17,228
And now we'll never know
who was behind this.

1038
02:18:17,427 --> 02:18:19,988
The trail's gone cold.

1039
02:19:47,517 --> 02:19:49,417
- Hello.
- Mr. White?

1040
02:19:49,618 --> 02:19:51,107
We need to talk.

1041
02:19:51,318 --> 02:19:53,187
Who is this?

1042
02:20:23,488 --> 02:20:25,478
The name's Bond.

1043
02:20:25,687 --> 02:20:27,628
James Bond.

1044
02:24:31,948 --> 02:24:33,448
...English...
