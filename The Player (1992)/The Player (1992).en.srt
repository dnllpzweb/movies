1
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,452
Quiet on the set.

2
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:27,454
Okay, everybody. Quiet on the set.

3
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:29,206
Scene one, take 10. Marker.

4
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:38,965
And action!

5
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,053
Joel Levison's office.

6
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:45,931
No, I'm sorry, he's not in yet.
May I take a message?

7
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:49,727
- Yes, Mr. Levy, I'll tell him you called.
- Sandy, never say that.

8
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,021
He's either in conference, in a meeting.
He's always in.

9
00:00:53,105 --> 00:00:55,440
- Now, who was that?
- A Larry Levy?

10
00:00:55,524 --> 00:00:56,942
Great.

11
00:00:57,025 --> 00:00:59,319
I hope there was nothing
in the trades this morning. Was there?

12
00:00:59,402 --> 00:01:01,780
- Well, I don't know. The mail's late.
- Well, go get 'em.

13
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:05,617
Now! I want them back here
before he arrives.

14
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:23,260
Griffin. Griffin, hi.

15
00:01:23,343 --> 00:01:25,053
Griffin, hi. A-A-Adam Simon.

16
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:28,474
- We're not supposed to meet till next week, but
— - I didn't realize we were meeting next week.

17
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:31,435
Well, I just wanted to plant the seed
in your head just now so that...

18
00:01:31,518 --> 00:01:33,479
I'm booked up.
I can't hear a pitch right now.

19
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:36,857
Picture this. It's a planet in the far,
far future, a planet with two suns.

20
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:39,401
- Who plays the sons?
- No, no. Suns. Large solar disks.

21
00:01:39,484 --> 00:01:41,403
Listen, run this idea by Bonnie Sherow.

22
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:44,656
Pictures they make these days
are all MTV. Cut, cut, cut, cut.

23
00:01:44,739 --> 00:01:48,410
The opening shot of Welles' <i>Touch of Evil</i>
was six and a half minutes long.

24
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:50,704
- Six and a half minutes, Walter?
- Well, three or four.

25
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:54,040
He set up the whole picture
with that one tracking shot.

26
00:01:54,124 --> 00:01:56,543
My father was the key grip on that shoot.

27
00:01:56,626 --> 00:02:00,589
Hey, what about <i>Absolute Beginners?</i>
Man, that was an extraordinary shot.

28
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:02,591
What the hell was that?
Never heard of it.

29
00:02:02,674 --> 00:02:04,802
It was Julian Temple.
It's an English film, Walter.

30
00:02:04,885 --> 00:02:08,597
We're talking about American movies,
and Orson Welles was a master.

31
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,516
- Pellegrino, please.
- I've got Calistoga.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,685
- Buck, how are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

33
00:02:13,768 --> 00:02:15,979
Good.
What do you got for me?

34
00:02:16,062 --> 00:02:18,231
Okay, here it is.

35
00:02:18,315 --> 00:02:20,358
<i>The Graduate Part Two.</i>

36
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,985
- Oh, good. Good.
- Now, listen.

37
00:02:22,068 --> 00:02:24,196
The three principals are still with us...

38
00:02:24,279 --> 00:02:27,157
Dustin Hoffman, Anne Bancroft,
Katharine Ross.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,533
Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:28,617 --> 00:02:30,953
Twenty-five years later.
And so are the characters.

41
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:34,706
Ben, Elaine and Mrs. Robinson.

42
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,791
Ben and Elaine are married, still.

43
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:41,379
They live in a big, old, spooky house
up in Northern California somewhere.

44
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:44,674
- And Mrs. Robinson lives with them.
- Mmm.

45
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:48,053
Her aging mother, who's had a stroke...

46
00:02:48,136 --> 00:02:49,679
Mrs. Robinson's had a stroke?

47
00:02:49,763 --> 00:02:51,682
Mrs. Robinson's had a stroke,
so she can't talk.

48
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:53,684
- Is this gonna be funny?
- Yeah, it'll be funny. Dark.

49
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,007
- With a stroke?
- And weird and funny and with a stroke.

50
00:02:56,061 --> 00:02:57,771
- Okay.
- Maybe it's not a stroke.

51
00:02:57,854 --> 00:02:59,773
- Maybe it's — I don't know what it is.
- Anyway, go on.

52
00:02:59,856 --> 00:03:01,233
- It's a malady of some sort.
- Okay.

53
00:03:01,316 --> 00:03:04,736
She's up there in the bedroom upstairs,
listening to everything that happens.

54
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,905
They've got a daughter
who's just graduated from college.

55
00:03:06,988 --> 00:03:08,490
That's good. Young blood.

56
00:03:08,573 --> 00:03:10,159
Twenty-two, twenty-three-year-old.

57
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:12,161
- Like a Julia Roberts.
- Julia Roberts. Great, great, great.

58
00:03:12,244 --> 00:03:14,663
Excuse me. What did you want me
to do with these scripts?

59
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:16,186
- That goes to Bonnie Sherow.
- Okay.

60
00:03:16,248 --> 00:03:20,002
And, uh, find out from studio security how
Adam Simon got on the lot. I wanna know.

61
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,170
Okay. Adam Simon? Okay.

62
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:24,381
- Okay?
- Yes, go ahead.

63
00:03:24,464 --> 00:03:26,550
Julia Roberts comes home.
Their daughter. The graduate.

64
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:28,051
Yes. The new graduate.

65
00:03:28,134 --> 00:03:29,553
- Th-The new graduate.
- The postgraduate.

66
00:03:29,636 --> 00:03:31,763
Griffin loved it.
He just wanted me to run it by you.

67
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:34,975
- It's a hardy band of human survivors.
- Listen, write this down for me. Okay?

68
00:03:35,058 --> 00:03:37,269
They have no history, only mythology.
They've lost all technological knowledge.

69
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:40,564
I can't process any of this unless you
write it down. Could you write it down?

70
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:42,807
- It's not about words. You gotta visualize it.
- Whoa!

71
00:03:42,857 --> 00:03:45,193
Oh, man.

72
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:48,488
Jimmy?

73
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:50,949
- Jimmy, are you okay? What happened?
- You gotta look where you're going.

74
00:03:51,032 --> 00:03:52,952
- Twenty-five words or less?
- Are you all right?

75
00:03:53,034 --> 00:03:54,953
I'd say. My name is Jimmy Chase.

76
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,955
- Are you all right? Open your eyes.
- Huh?

77
00:03:57,038 --> 00:04:00,292
- Are you okay?
- He came outta nowhere, ran into the car.

78
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:02,544
- I never saw the guy coming.
- It's okay.

79
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:05,672
Yeah, it's okay.

80
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:07,632
Hey, that's Adam Simon.

81
00:04:07,716 --> 00:04:09,843
How ya doin', kid?
I was just having a...

82
00:04:09,926 --> 00:04:11,637
- You all right?
- Yeah, it was good.

83
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,513
You sure you're okay?

84
00:04:18,184 --> 00:04:21,604
Rebecca De Mornay.
Actually, you're much better looking.

85
00:04:21,688 --> 00:04:23,773
Um, no.
No, I'm not Rebecca De Mornay.

86
00:04:23,857 --> 00:04:26,276
- Dead ringer.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

87
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:29,195
Hey, do you know where
Joel Levison's office is?

88
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:32,157
<i>The</i> Mr. Levison?
Head of the studio? Yeah.

89
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,240
It's quite, quite moving.
It'll rip your heart out.

90
00:04:34,284 --> 00:04:38,788
This is the area where we make decisions to
give a green light to a picture like that.

91
00:04:38,872 --> 00:04:41,667
Right here. We're gonna go
about 17 stories high, if we can.

92
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,002
We're going to continue
using all the Sony products.

93
00:04:44,085 --> 00:04:46,671
<i>Domo arigato</i> to the Sony products, really.

94
00:04:46,755 --> 00:04:51,176
In fact, if you need someone to eat sashimi
with you, you give me a ring, because...

95
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:52,677
Here's Levison, right here.

96
00:04:52,761 --> 00:04:56,111
- Come with me to my office.
- I have to know that you're seeing it.

97
00:04:57,307 --> 00:04:59,893
- Good girl.
- Traffic from Malibu was impossible.

98
00:04:59,976 --> 00:05:01,478
- Morning, Joel.
- Morning, Celia.

99
00:05:01,561 --> 00:05:03,772
- Sandy, park the car, please.
- Okay.

100
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:06,608
- Morning, Marty, Annie, Frank.
- Hi.

101
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,194
What are those Japs doing here?

102
00:05:09,277 --> 00:05:12,197
What's all this talk going
around here about heads will roll?

103
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,949
The bank's putting the screws to us.

104
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:17,119
Harvey Goldman's son's coming out
from Boston and I don't like it.

105
00:05:17,202 --> 00:05:20,330
Reggie Goldman's a pip-squeak.
It can't be serious.

106
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:23,833
- Quite an actor, though.
- Some changes are going on around here.

107
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:27,837
It's always the way. Happened
at Paramount three years ago.

108
00:05:27,921 --> 00:05:30,131
Columbia's going through it now.

109
00:05:30,215 --> 00:05:32,384
I hear we're looking to replace Griffin.

110
00:05:32,467 --> 00:05:33,718
- Griffin?
- Mm-hmm.

111
00:05:33,802 --> 00:05:37,055
- I don't believe it. With who?
- Berg. Kirkpatrick. Maybe Larry Levy.

112
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:38,515
Yeah.

113
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:42,143
Yeah, well, I want to know
why the security is so lax. That's why.

114
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:45,147
I'll talk to you about it later.
I'm in the middle of a pitch. Okay.

115
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,440
- Listen, go ahead.
- Yeah, okay, okay.

116
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:50,444
- A TV star goes on safari in Africa.
- Like a Donna Mills or a Joan Collins.

117
00:05:50,527 --> 00:05:53,446
You're talking about a TV star
in a major motion picture?

118
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,574
No, not a real TV star.
It would be played by a movie star.

119
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:56,575
A movie star playing a television star
in a major motion picture.

120
00:05:56,658 --> 00:06:01,246
- Goldie, Julia, Michelle, Bette, Lily, Dolly.
- Julia Roberts. Dolly Parton would be good.

121
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:03,915
You know, I — I like Goldie.
I like Goldie.

122
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:06,585
- Great. 'Cause we have a relationship.
<i>- Goldie Goes to Africa.</i>

123
00:06:06,668 --> 00:06:07,586
That would be great.

124
00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:10,005
<i>- Goldie Goes to Africa.
- Goldie Goes to Africa.</i>

125
00:06:10,088 --> 00:06:12,090
- And she becomes worshipped.
- Worshipped?

126
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:13,813
- Well, she's found by this tribe —
- Yes?

127
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:16,803
Of small people. But then
she has to go back to her life.

128
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:18,972
She's found by this tribe
and they worship her.

129
00:06:19,055 --> 00:06:21,433
Oh, I see. It's kind of like
a <i>Gods Must Be Crazy,</i>

130
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:23,602
except the Coke bottle's
now a television actress.

131
00:06:23,685 --> 00:06:26,021
Yeah, it's exactly right.
It's <i>Out of Africa</i> meets <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

132
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:28,440
- Well, but you know what?
- She has to decide whether...

133
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:30,442
- You know what we could do?
- To stay with the TV show

134
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,153
- or save this entire African tribe.
- It could be a man.

135
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,530
- Hey, where's Griffin Mill's office?
- Right here.

136
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:38,533
- Hey, you're Martin Scorsese.
- No, but I know Harvey Keitel.

137
00:06:38,616 --> 00:06:42,120
Yeah, I know you do.
Hey, I loved <i>Cape Fear.</i>

138
00:06:42,203 --> 00:06:43,997
My old man worked for Hitchcock too.

139
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,125
- Yeah?
<i>- Rope.</i> It was a masterpiece.

140
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,128
Story wasn't any good.
He shot the whole thing without cuts.

141
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:52,130
I hate all this cut, cut, cut.

142
00:06:52,213 --> 00:06:54,340
Oh, yeah, well, what about Bertolucci?

143
00:06:54,424 --> 00:06:57,302
That great tracking shot with Winger
in <i>Sheltering Sky?</i>

144
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,761
I didn't see it.

145
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,225
<i>Touch of Evil,</i> that was the one.
Welles, Hitchcock...

146
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:05,602
- I've been here since 8:00.
- You were in the commissary, Whitney.

147
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:08,230
I stuck my neck out for you to
get this job. Who were you with?

148
00:07:08,313 --> 00:07:12,984
- I-I was in there with, um, A-Alan Rudolph.
- What were you doing with Alan Rudolph?

149
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:16,321
He asked me to have coffee
and he was telling me this idea he had.

150
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:19,004
Whitney, you're my assistant.
You don't get involved with writers.

151
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:21,785
I wasn't getting involved. I was just
listening to this amazing idea he had.

152
00:07:21,868 --> 00:07:24,548
- I told him he should give it to you.
- What's your pitch?

153
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:26,247
Well, does political scare you?

154
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:29,501
Political doesn't scare me.
Radical political scares me.

155
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,461
- This is —
<i>- Political</i> political scares me.

156
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:32,796
<i>Politely</i> politically radical.

157
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,380
- Is it funny?
- It's funny.

158
00:07:34,464 --> 00:07:36,842
- It's a funny political thing.
- And it's a thriller too.

159
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,801
- It's a thriller?
- And all at once.

160
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:41,513
- So, uh, what's the story?
- Well, I want Bruce Willis.

161
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:43,264
I think I can talk to him.

162
00:07:43,348 --> 00:07:46,476
It's a story about a senator.
A bad-guy senator, at first.

163
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:49,187
He's traveling around the country
on the country's dime, you know,

164
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,855
like that Sununu guy used to.

165
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:53,483
I see. So it's sort of
a cynical, political thriller-comedy?

166
00:07:53,566 --> 00:07:56,027
Yeah, but it's got a heart,
uh, in the right spot.

167
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,530
And, anyway, he has an accident.

168
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:01,616
- An accident?
- Yeah, and he becomes clairvoyant.

169
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:03,743
- Like a psychic.
- Oh, I see.

170
00:08:03,826 --> 00:08:06,913
So it's kind of a psychic,
political thriller-comedy with a heart.

171
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:08,456
With a heart.

172
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,251
Not unlike <i>Ghost</i>
meets <i>Manchurian Candidate.</i>

173
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:14,837
- Go on, go on, I'm listening.
- Anyway, he can read people's minds.

174
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:18,216
And when he gets to the president's mind,
it's completely blank.

175
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:20,635
- Completely blank!
- Can I get you anything?

176
00:08:20,718 --> 00:08:22,929
- I'd like a beer, please.
- We don't have beer.

177
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:25,348
Uh, okay, wine.
Red wine, please.

178
00:08:26,933 --> 00:08:30,883
Of course someone gets killed at the end.
They always do in political thrillers.

179
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:35,025
- Griffin Mill's office.
<i>- Yeah, I know that. Can you put him on?</i>

180
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:37,861
- It's an intriguing idea, Jim.
- May I ask who's calling, please?

181
00:08:37,944 --> 00:08:40,155
<i>- Griffin Mill, please.</i>
- We gotta get somebody really dangerous.

182
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:42,824
- Well, he's in a meeting right now.
- You know, Bruce Willis or Mel Gibson.

183
00:08:42,907 --> 00:08:44,576
- Great. Let me get back to you.
- Thanks.

184
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:46,244
- Excuse me, sir.
<i>- Bullshit, lady.</i>

185
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:48,163
<i>- He'll get back to me?</i>
- Seen my Binaca anywhere?

186
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,582
<i>Do you know how many times
I have heard that?</i>

187
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,876
- Who is this?
<i>- If he don't get back to me, tell him —</i>

188
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,878
- Griffin, I read that script.
- Who was that?

189
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:57,547
- I don't know. He didn't say.
- It's a nice idea. Just maybe a little soft.

190
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,549
I don't know how you're
gonna cast it through.

191
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:03,094
The lead character is a 50-year-old
female circus performer. A fire-eater.

192
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,388
Let me read the coverage.

193
00:09:05,471 --> 00:09:08,350
- Are we still having lunch with Aaron Camp?
- Yeah. What time?

194
00:09:08,433 --> 00:09:10,602
I made it for 1:00.

195
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:13,521
- Bad day?
- He's having writer's block.

196
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:18,610
Griffin, you have a meeting with Harders
and Frank South this afternoon.

197
00:09:18,693 --> 00:09:20,028
- What time?
- At 3:00.

198
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,405
I'll be here. Put this morning's
meetings in the computer.

199
00:09:22,488 --> 00:09:24,490
- All right.
- Thanks.

200
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:26,993
- Are you going now?
- No. I'm going to see Levison.

201
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:30,538
I'll meet you there. Order me
a Caesar salad and Crystal Geyser.

202
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:33,625
Thanks.

203
00:09:38,963 --> 00:09:40,298
- Okay, by 5:00?
- Mm-hmm.

204
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,133
- Thanks, Sandy.
- Bye.

205
00:09:42,216 --> 00:09:44,678
- Hi, Sandy. Hi, Celia.
- Griffin, you can't go in there.

206
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:46,262
He's in a meeting.

207
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:48,848
So I think, you know,
dime-a-dozen out here, don't you?

208
00:09:48,931 --> 00:09:51,267
- It's all right, Celia.
- You know this one?

209
00:09:51,351 --> 00:09:55,313
I don't think you've met Reg Goldman.
You know his father, Harvey.

210
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,900
Yes, of course. Hi, Reg.
From the bank in Boston. Right.

211
00:09:58,983 --> 00:10:01,069
Reg is out here for a couple of weeks.

212
00:10:01,152 --> 00:10:02,654
Great.

213
00:10:02,737 --> 00:10:05,907
- Business or pleasure?
- A little of both, I hope.

214
00:10:06,741 --> 00:10:09,077
Reg is thinking of getting
into production, Griffin.

215
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,912
Oh, really?

216
00:10:10,995 --> 00:10:13,498
Yeah. Beats work.
Doesn't it, Griffin?

217
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:15,958
Like to play tennis though.
You play tennis?

218
00:10:16,042 --> 00:10:19,337
Tennis? No, no, no, I, uh —
I'm too busy for...

219
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,508
See, I was just asking Walter here,
uh, do you know Meg Ryan?

220
00:10:23,591 --> 00:10:25,593
You know if she's seeing somebody?

221
00:10:26,886 --> 00:10:29,263
Um, yeah, Reg, she's married.

222
00:10:30,348 --> 00:10:31,849
Shit.

223
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,602
What about Winona Ryder?

224
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:39,524
Um, well, uh, you know, actually,
Walter is the guy to talk to.

225
00:10:39,607 --> 00:10:41,359
Walter's got everybody's number.

226
00:10:41,442 --> 00:10:44,654
- Was there anything?
- Uh, no. You're real busy.

227
00:10:46,072 --> 00:10:49,409
I want that number, goddamn it.
I want that number.

228
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:53,287
Oh, boy. What about this one here?
Has she done anything?

229
00:10:54,288 --> 00:10:55,790
Celia.

230
00:10:57,083 --> 00:11:00,002
Griffin, don't ask.

231
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:04,549
Don't ask, "You don't know,"
or don't ask, "I don't want to know"?

232
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:06,718
Just don't ask.

233
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:12,473
Look, if it's — If it's Reggie Goldman
you're concerned about, forget it.

234
00:11:12,557 --> 00:11:15,477
But be nice to him. He represents
a lot of money for this company.

235
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,563
It's not Reggie Goldman I'm worried about.

236
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:20,064
It's Larry Levy.

237
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,024
Larry Levy?

238
00:11:22,108 --> 00:11:24,569
Larry Levy's at Fox, isn't he?

239
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:28,197
Oh, come on, Celia.

240
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:31,868
<i>Sandy, there's a call
for Celia on line one.</i>

241
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:35,496
- Should I be looking for a job?
<i>- Celia, are you there?</i>

242
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,373
Joel Levison's office.

243
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:39,959
Oh, Brad. Yeah.

244
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:41,419
What?

245
00:11:41,502 --> 00:11:44,089
No, we couldn't sign Anjelica Huston
for that project.

246
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:46,132
She's booked for the next two years.

247
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:48,134
Yeah, like a ghost story,

248
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:50,428
but that's not like <i>Ghost.</i>

249
00:11:50,511 --> 00:11:52,097
- Well, not — No.
- Which may be...

250
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,057
We should be —
I understand what you're saying.

251
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,990
It'd be called <i>Unnatural Lives.</i>
It's a supernatural thing.

252
00:11:58,686 --> 00:12:01,439
Joel. Griffin Mill.
Friend of Jennifer's.

253
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:02,899
No, no.

254
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:04,609
- You're Griffin Mill?
- Yes.

255
00:12:04,692 --> 00:12:06,444
- Really?
- Good to see you. I'm a big fan of yours.

256
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,279
- I have that tie.
- You do?

257
00:12:08,362 --> 00:12:11,612
- Mr. Mill, how are you today?
- Okay. How are you doing, Natalie?

258
00:12:15,912 --> 00:12:17,914
- Did you order for me?
- Yes.

259
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:20,666
- Hey, Griffin.
- Hi, everybody.

260
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,876
- Hi.
- How are you?

261
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:24,295
- Lunching with the enemy, hmm?
- Ooh!

262
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:28,216
- Oh, come on.
- So, what's this we hear about Larry Levy?

263
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,052
Larry Levy?

264
00:12:31,135 --> 00:12:33,387
If he had half a brain, he'd be dangerous.

265
00:12:35,097 --> 00:12:37,517
Aaron says he's coming to the studio.

266
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,477
Aaron says, eh?

267
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,479
Why would you believe anything he says?

268
00:12:41,562 --> 00:12:44,690
Well, he said it.
It's the authority he said it with.

269
00:12:44,774 --> 00:12:46,317
- He's over there.
- Who?

270
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,820
With Anjelica Huston and John Cusack.

271
00:12:48,903 --> 00:12:50,071
- Levy?
- Yep.

272
00:12:50,154 --> 00:12:53,074
He's in over his head.
He's gonna drown over there.

273
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,578
He's quite the golden boy
at Fox these days.

274
00:12:56,661 --> 00:13:01,040
Did you see that thing on him
in <i>Variety</i> last week? It was two pages.

275
00:13:01,123 --> 00:13:03,167
- Anjelica. Griffin Mill.
- Oh, hi.

276
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:05,336
- Good to see you. You're looking great.
- You too.

277
00:13:05,419 --> 00:13:08,130
- Hey, Johnny. Griffin Mill. Big fan of yours.
- Yeah.

278
00:13:08,214 --> 00:13:11,176
- You gonna be in Telluride this year?
- Probably gonna be in Park City.

279
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,678
- Oh, great. We'll see you there.
- Okay.

280
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,346
Ai-yi-yi.

281
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:17,098
What's happening with <i>Glass Box?</i>

282
00:13:17,181 --> 00:13:20,268
Can we talk about something
other than Hollywood for a change?

283
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,894
- Yes.
- We're educated people.

284
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:24,146
- Sure.
- Sure, Griffin.

285
00:13:28,609 --> 00:13:30,444
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

286
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:33,155
Bye.

287
00:14:03,102 --> 00:14:05,022
Shouldn't you talk to somebody about this?

288
00:14:05,104 --> 00:14:06,522
- What?
- These postcards.

289
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:08,483
- You've gotten five in two weeks.
- Seven, actually.

290
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:11,152
Griffin, why don't you just
talk to studio security?

291
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,488
I'm supposed to call Walter Stuckel
and say what?

292
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:16,241
"Walter, listen, someone's
sending me poison pen letters

293
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:19,744
and I would like for you to make me
the object of more ridicule and abuse,

294
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:21,955
now that things are really shaky
for me here."

295
00:14:22,038 --> 00:14:25,208
- No, I don't think so, Jan.
- I think they're coming from a writer.

296
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:27,501
- Which one?
- Take your pick.

297
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:32,382
- Is there anything else?
- Yes. Your attorney phoned.

298
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:34,545
He wants you to come to a party
at his house tonight.

299
00:14:34,592 --> 00:14:36,392
Get me out of it.
Tell him I'm in a screening.

300
00:14:36,469 --> 00:14:39,805
- Not that attorney. It's Dick Mellen.
- Oh, Dick. What time?

301
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:42,016
Cocktails at 7:30.
Dinner at 8:00. Bring a date.

302
00:14:42,099 --> 00:14:44,394
- If I have to read one more goddamn — -
Oh, and Bonnie Sherow is here to see you.

303
00:14:44,477 --> 00:14:46,854
- Sensitive male bonding script.
- Send her in.

304
00:14:46,938 --> 00:14:48,189
Oh, here she is.

305
00:14:48,272 --> 00:14:50,983
Griffin, can we go to the Springs
this weekend?

306
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,944
I want to have a massage.

307
00:14:53,027 --> 00:14:55,988
I want to have a long soak
in a hot mineral tub.

308
00:14:56,072 --> 00:14:59,075
And I want to have margaritas
administered intravenously.

309
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:01,536
I have a party tonight at Dick Mellen's.
You wanna come?

310
00:15:01,619 --> 00:15:03,996
Oh, God.
Movie stars and power players.

311
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,123
- And vodka.
- Sure.

312
00:15:07,124 --> 00:15:10,378
It'll be an early dinner
and we'll go to my place afterwards.

313
00:15:10,461 --> 00:15:11,963
- Can we?
- Yeah.

314
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:28,854
And Brokaw looks like
he has absolutely no retention.

315
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:31,983
But Ted Koppel looks loose
and he goes after it and he digs in

316
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,026
and he doesn't get thrown very easily.

317
00:15:36,112 --> 00:15:38,030
Oh.

318
00:15:38,114 --> 00:15:40,658
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi, Griffin.

319
00:15:40,741 --> 00:15:42,994
Marlee, this is Bonnie Sherow.

320
00:15:43,077 --> 00:15:46,914
She read, um, <i>Tales of Fury,</i> and...

321
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:48,916
- Oh!
- I loved it.

322
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,418
- That's great.
- It was wonderful.

323
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:53,755
- And I think you're perfect for Ariel.
- Thank you. I think so too.

324
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:55,297
Yeah.

325
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:58,467
We were gonna make just
a couple of changes in the third act.

326
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:00,553
- You should set up a meeting.
- Yeah.

327
00:16:00,636 --> 00:16:03,389
- Yeah, yeah. Don't you think?
- Yeah, sure. Y-Yes.

328
00:16:03,472 --> 00:16:06,142
- 'Cause you have my number?
- Yeah, absolutely.

329
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:10,229
Excuse me. I'm gonna go say hello
to these people here.

330
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:12,648
You don't talk about
script changes at parties.

331
00:16:12,732 --> 00:16:13,941
All right, I'm sorry.

332
00:16:14,025 --> 00:16:17,695
It was good of you to come.
Don't you look beautiful, uh...

333
00:16:17,778 --> 00:16:20,448
- You know Bonnie Sherow.
- B — Of course. How are you, dear?

334
00:16:20,531 --> 00:16:23,868
- It's good to see you. TriStar, right?
- No, she's at, uh — she's at the studio.

335
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:26,537
Yeah, that's — that's what I meant.
And how about, uh...

336
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,206
Bring Mr. Mill a martini.
And, Bunny, how about...

337
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,050
- Actually, I'll take a Ramlösa.
- All right.

338
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:34,211
- I'll have a martini.
- Okay. One of each.

339
00:16:34,295 --> 00:16:35,880
Rod Steiger's here.

340
00:16:35,963 --> 00:16:39,300
Why don't you, uh — Why don't you
talk to him about the Rudolph project.

341
00:16:39,383 --> 00:16:43,888
He's not that hot on it, but, uh, see if you
can get him to at least, you know, read it.

342
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,140
- Okay.
- You know who's here? Harry Belafonte.

343
00:16:46,223 --> 00:16:47,863
- Harry!
- I love Harry Belafonte.

344
00:16:47,892 --> 00:16:49,685
Come and say hello, will ya?

345
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:51,562
Harry, say hello to a couple of people.

346
00:16:51,645 --> 00:16:54,065
- Griffin Mill and Bunny.
- Hi, Harry. Good to see you.

347
00:16:54,148 --> 00:16:56,609
- Hi. Bonnie Sherow.
- She's just gaga over you.

348
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,360
I'm a big fan of yours.

349
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:01,155
I saw you accept
the Nelson Mandela Courage Award.

350
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,244
Who was the guy in <i>Ghostbusters?</i>
Uh, you know, the villain in <i>Ghostbusters.</i>

351
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:09,121
I — I — You got me. That wasn't...

352
00:17:09,205 --> 00:17:11,290
I got this, um...

353
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:15,628
This po — I got this postcard.

354
00:17:15,711 --> 00:17:17,755
You know, harassment kind of stuff.
But you know.

355
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,133
I don't. Tell me.
What are you talking about?

356
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:24,720
Well, I — it's some writer
I must've brushed off.

357
00:17:24,804 --> 00:17:27,974
Folks, get something to eat.
There's some lovely stuff over there.

358
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:30,393
- We're wasting away.
- We will, in a few minutes. Thank you.

359
00:17:30,476 --> 00:17:32,979
- Your hands are as cold as mine.
- My hands are freezing.

360
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:35,690
- Would you like one of these?
- Um, I don't think I do.

361
00:17:35,773 --> 00:17:37,233
That one, right there.

362
00:17:37,316 --> 00:17:39,527
Not threats?
You talking about threats?

363
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,612
Well, no.

364
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:43,572
Y-Yes — I don't know.

365
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,033
He's pissed off.

366
00:17:46,117 --> 00:17:50,538
I thought writers were your long suit.
You're the writer's executive, aren't you?

367
00:17:50,621 --> 00:17:52,623
Are you pitching me a dream?

368
00:17:52,706 --> 00:17:55,626
The way you say that, that's what makes me
think you're not really sincerely interested.

369
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,909
Well, it depends
how good the dream is, Jeff.

370
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,339
Levy's here.

371
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:07,138
- Check the people over there, okay?
- Dick. Dick. What's he doing here?

372
00:18:07,221 --> 00:18:10,057
- Goldblum? He's a friend.
- No. Larry Levy.

373
00:18:10,141 --> 00:18:13,311
- He came with Sally. He's a buddy —
- What's going on with my job?

374
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:16,939
I mean, you know, Larry Levy — Everywhere
I look, you know, he's in my face.

375
00:18:17,022 --> 00:18:21,068
Larry Levy's a comer. That's what
comers do. They get in your face.

376
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,321
You're a comer too. You can
handle him. Stop worrying about it.

377
00:18:24,405 --> 00:18:26,407
So the rumors are true?

378
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:28,492
Rumors are always true.
You know that.

379
00:18:28,576 --> 00:18:31,536
- I'm always the last to hear about them.
- You're the last one to believe.

380
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,497
I've told you that before.

381
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:34,999
So am I out?

382
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,085
Not out. But you'd better start
thinking about a roommate.

383
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:41,297
Relax. You can handle this.
You can make him work for you.

384
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,382
- Excuse me.
- Larry?

385
00:18:43,465 --> 00:18:46,260
Dick.
Sorry to crash your party.

386
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:48,513
- Do you know everybody?
- I will before the night's out.

387
00:18:48,596 --> 00:18:51,724
You will. You will, indeed.
It's a good crowd of people.

388
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:56,020
- Great party, Dick.
- Good.

389
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:59,106
- Did you get some food?
- Actually, not yet.

390
00:19:02,484 --> 00:19:04,612
Hmm. Listen to this.
Listen to this.

391
00:19:04,695 --> 00:19:07,531
"He lifts her dress.
She kisses him harder.

392
00:19:07,615 --> 00:19:11,368
He puts his hands in her underpants.
She grabs his shoulders.

393
00:19:11,452 --> 00:19:16,207
He pulls her dress above her waist.
He rubs against her wide, soft belly.

394
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:19,376
Slowly, he pushes her panties
down to her knees.

395
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,003
She is faint with passion.

396
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:24,048
She arches her back
and he lowers her down onto the buckboard.

397
00:19:24,131 --> 00:19:26,217
The horses snort and whinny.

398
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,844
They too seem to be feeling her passion.

399
00:19:28,928 --> 00:19:31,430
The camera moves in
on the nostrils of the horse

400
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:33,933
as the buckboard begins to shake."

401
00:19:34,016 --> 00:19:35,559
Oh, my God.

402
00:19:35,643 --> 00:19:38,562
Can you believe that?
Steve recommended that script.

403
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:40,565
He says they're really hot for it
over at Universal.

404
00:19:40,648 --> 00:19:42,733
They're gonna have a bidding war.

405
00:19:42,816 --> 00:19:46,403
I heard a pitch today. It wasn't bad.
I'm stuck on a story point though.

406
00:19:46,487 --> 00:19:47,947
I'm a story editor. Go.

407
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,033
New York City. Madison Avenue.
Big advertising agency.

408
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:54,245
An account executive makes a presentation
to someone he wants as a client.

409
00:19:54,328 --> 00:19:56,705
The client promises to get back to him.

410
00:19:56,789 --> 00:19:59,292
- Does it have to be advertising?
- That's not the problem.

411
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:03,003
The account executive keeps waiting
for the client to call him back,

412
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:06,883
to tell him what he thought of the idea,
to tell him if he got the job or not.

413
00:20:06,966 --> 00:20:09,385
- But the client never calls.
- Mm-hmm.

414
00:20:09,468 --> 00:20:12,388
So the account executive
gets so pissed off, so frustrated,

415
00:20:12,471 --> 00:20:14,265
that he becomes obsessive

416
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:16,767
and he decides to drive the client crazy.

417
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:20,187
- What does he do?
- Sends him threatening postcards.

418
00:20:20,271 --> 00:20:22,189
It's not important.

419
00:20:22,273 --> 00:20:23,732
Here's the problem.

420
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:29,029
How long do you think
the account executive harasses the client

421
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,324
before he becomes dangerous?

422
00:20:32,408 --> 00:20:35,452
- Does it have to be advertising?
- How long?

423
00:20:35,536 --> 00:20:37,288
All right, if it were me...

424
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:40,708
- One month?
- Three months.

425
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,086
No, no, no. More. Five months.
I mean, to be dangerous, five months.

426
00:20:44,169 --> 00:20:45,463
That's what I thought.
Five months.

427
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:47,589
- Who's the writer?
- I don't know.

428
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:50,801
You don't know the writer
who pitched you the idea?

429
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:54,346
Uh, his name — I don't know.
It's a couple kids, uh...

430
00:20:55,347 --> 00:20:57,641
- TV writers.
- Mmm.

431
00:20:58,475 --> 00:21:02,229
Can we go to bed now?
I'm starting to wrinkle.

432
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:09,903
All right.

433
00:21:09,987 --> 00:21:11,864
- See you tomorrow afternoon.
- Absolutely.

434
00:21:11,947 --> 00:21:13,324
Burt? Larry Levy.

435
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:16,160
I hope you don't remember me, and if
you do, I hope there are no hard feelings.

436
00:21:16,243 --> 00:21:19,288
- I was only working for Kastner at the time.
- Yeah, right.

437
00:21:24,418 --> 00:21:26,253
- Thank you.
- Take care.

438
00:21:26,337 --> 00:21:29,340
- Who's that?
- Uh, an exec over at Fox.

439
00:21:29,423 --> 00:21:31,425
Or was until this breakfast anyway.

440
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,852
Good morning, Mr. Mill.
Welcome to Geoffrey's.

441
00:21:41,935 --> 00:21:44,188
Hi, Susan. How are you?
I'm with Joel.

442
00:21:45,439 --> 00:21:48,525
- Hi, Burt. Griffin Mill.
- Oh, hi, Griffin. Good to see you.

443
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:50,653
- Griffin. Nice to see you this morning.
- Hi, Charles. How are you?

444
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:52,336
Asshole.

445
00:21:52,363 --> 00:21:54,031
- One of a breed, yes.
- Mmm.

446
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:55,324
Hi, Kathy.

447
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:58,536
No, actually, he's not one of a breed.
There's a whole breed of them.

448
00:21:58,619 --> 00:21:59,996
- They're breeding them actually.
- Yes.

449
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,079
Joel, you're losing your touch, scheduling
these meetings so close together.

450
00:22:03,123 --> 00:22:05,793
The guy didn't have time
to finish his breakfast.

451
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:07,795
He'd already eaten.
Gets up early.

452
00:22:07,878 --> 00:22:09,171
Yeah.

453
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:12,383
- You went to Mellen's last night, I hear.
- Could you take this away, please? Yes, I did.

454
00:22:12,466 --> 00:22:14,635
- How is he?
- I'd like a Vittel water.

455
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,055
He's fine.

456
00:22:18,138 --> 00:22:20,474
You left early. Why?

457
00:22:20,557 --> 00:22:23,560
We had to work on the, uh —
On the museum party.

458
00:22:24,645 --> 00:22:27,231
I will not work for Larry Levy.

459
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,441
I'm not asking you to.

460
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:34,571
I report to you.
If I have to report to Larry Levy, I quit.

461
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:38,409
You can't quit.

462
00:22:38,492 --> 00:22:40,244
I won't let you quit.

463
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:42,246
You have a year and a half
on your contract,

464
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:46,792
and I will sue you for breach if you don't
show up in the office every day with a smile.

465
00:22:47,793 --> 00:22:49,837
Why Levy?

466
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,547
Levy was available.

467
00:22:52,673 --> 00:22:55,134
He's good on material.
You're good with writers.

468
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:57,967
We're a team.
He's a new member of the team. That's all.

469
00:22:58,846 --> 00:23:01,014
He can make us all look good.

470
00:23:01,098 --> 00:23:04,598
This is a red wine glass. Can I have
my water in a water glass, please?

471
00:23:05,394 --> 00:23:07,020
Well?

472
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:10,107
I'll have to think about it, Joel.

473
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,067
I want an answer this afternoon.

474
00:23:12,151 --> 00:23:14,778
Well, I have to go out to Palmdale.

475
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:17,865
The director of <i>The Lonely Room</i>
is giving Lily a hard time.

476
00:23:19,074 --> 00:23:22,619
- I'll be back around 5:00.
- So call after 5:00.

477
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:24,163
I'll get back to you.

478
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:27,166
But I said, you haven't gone —
You haven't died enough.

479
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:29,418
So he's still hanging on.

480
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:42,389
<i>Griffin.</i>

481
00:23:42,473 --> 00:23:44,475
- Yeah.
<i>- Joel Levison on line two.</i>

482
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:46,477
<i>- I'll put him through?</i>
- No, no. I'll get back to him.

483
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,479
<i>You want me to tell Joel Levison
you'll get back to him?</i>

484
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:49,813
- Yeah.
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

485
00:23:49,897 --> 00:23:52,399
I don't want to hear what he's got to say.

486
00:24:01,408 --> 00:24:04,536
- How did this get here?
- The mail?

487
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,498
Yeah, but this does not have a postmark.
This was hand delivered.

488
00:24:07,581 --> 00:24:09,500
Not to me.
It came with the mail.

489
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:11,418
Jimmy!

490
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:13,378
Huh?

491
00:24:13,462 --> 00:24:16,762
You know anything about this?
Who delivered it? Where it came from?

492
00:24:17,257 --> 00:24:19,092
Mail room?

493
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,679
Yeah, but I want to know
how it got to the goddamn mail room.

494
00:24:21,762 --> 00:24:24,640
- Find out for me and get back to me.
- Okay. Sure.

495
00:24:24,723 --> 00:24:26,558
You go with him.

496
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:29,562
- You want me to go to the mail room?
- Yes, I want you to go to the mail room.

497
00:24:29,645 --> 00:24:34,274
And while you're there, I would like
a, uh, copy of <i>The Lonely Room</i> rewrites.

498
00:24:34,358 --> 00:24:36,068
In white pages. No color.

499
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:39,655
- And find out how this got in my mail.
- Yes, sir.

500
00:24:39,738 --> 00:24:43,534
- You'll get your own phones, I take it?
- Yes, I can get my own phone, Jan.

501
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:51,333
Son of a bitch.

502
00:24:51,416 --> 00:24:55,504
Five months.
One, two, three, four, five.

503
00:24:55,587 --> 00:24:57,130
April.

504
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,386
Pitches. Richard Fielder.
David Lucas.

505
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:04,096
Adam Silverstein.

506

Bill Lindstrom. David Kahane.

Sam Potenza.

508

Incoming.

509
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,405
Incoming.

510
00:25:21,488 --> 00:25:23,532
Unreturned calls.

511
00:25:23,615 --> 00:25:26,326
Bill Lindstrom again.

512
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,912
Nancy Franklin.
Wouldn't be a woman.

513
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:30,914
David Kahane.

514
00:25:30,998 --> 00:25:32,541
Bill Lindstrom.

515
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:35,335
Oh, come on.
Sort, sort, sort, sort.

516
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:37,004
Come on.

517
00:25:38,297 --> 00:25:41,341
Oh, come on, come on.
Kahane. Kahane. Kahane. Lindstrom.

518
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:43,552
Lindstrom.
White pages.

519
00:25:44,595 --> 00:25:48,473
"Lindstrom.
Disney. Strategic planning."

520
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:49,850
Wouldn't be him.

521
00:25:49,933 --> 00:25:52,394
What was that other guy's name?

522
00:25:53,478 --> 00:25:57,065
Kahane. Kahane. "J." "K."

523
00:25:57,149 --> 00:25:58,942
Kalchime.

524
00:25:59,026 --> 00:26:00,736
Kahane.

525
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,988
"Unproduced."
Got ya!

526
00:27:00,754 --> 00:27:03,799
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes, hello. Is David Kahane there, please?

527
00:27:03,882 --> 00:27:05,133
David!

528
00:27:09,388 --> 00:27:11,056
Dave!

529
00:27:12,557 --> 00:27:15,435
<i>Hello? I'm really sorry. I forgot.
He's gone out.</i>

530
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:16,770
- Oh, I see.
<i>- Who's this?</i>

531
00:27:16,853 --> 00:27:18,689
This is Griffin Mill.

532
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:20,148
<i>Oh, the dead man.</i>

533
00:27:20,232 --> 00:27:22,609
- What did you just say?
<i>- Hmm?</i>

534
00:27:22,693 --> 00:27:25,278
<i>- Oh, nothing.</i>
- About me being a dead man.

535
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:29,366
<i>Just, uh, a nickname David has for you.</i>

536
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:31,034
Oh. I see.

537
00:27:31,118 --> 00:27:33,245
That's a funny nickname.

538
00:27:33,328 --> 00:27:37,207
So I suppose your husband
doesn't like me very much.

539
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,459
<i>I don't have a husband.</i>

540
00:27:39,543 --> 00:27:41,795
I suppose <i>David</i> doesn't like me very much.

541
00:27:41,878 --> 00:27:44,089
<i>David's, um, gone to the cinema.</i>

542
00:27:44,172 --> 00:27:45,924
When will he be back?

543
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:48,260
<i>When the film's over, I presume.</i>

544
00:27:48,343 --> 00:27:50,887
And you are?

545
00:27:50,971 --> 00:27:53,140
<i>- June.</i>
- June?

546
00:27:53,223 --> 00:27:56,059
<i>Here we go.
You want to know my last name.</i>

547
00:27:56,143 --> 00:27:58,604
<i>Well, you won't be able to pronounce it.
No one can.</i>

548
00:27:58,687 --> 00:28:00,105
Try me.

549
00:28:00,188 --> 00:28:01,857
<i>Gudmundsdottir.</i>

550
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,442
"Goodmanzdaughter."

551
00:28:03,525 --> 00:28:06,778
<i>- Gudmundsdottir.</i>
- Gudmundsdottir.

552
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:09,448
- How's that?
<i>- Hey, you're very good.</i>

553
00:28:09,531 --> 00:28:10,991
Thanks.

554
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:14,786
What do people usually say?

555
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,037
<i>Oh, don't ask.</i>

556
00:28:16,121 --> 00:28:21,084
<i>Anything from "Gooddogzwater"
to "Goulashwallop."</i>

557
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:25,422
- You English?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

558
00:28:25,505 --> 00:28:27,674
<i>Well, no. No, not really.</i>

559
00:28:27,758 --> 00:28:30,927
Well, where are you
kind of sort of not from?

560
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:34,931
<i>Well, do you want the long story
or the short one?</i>

561
00:28:35,015 --> 00:28:37,142
- The long one.
<i>- No, you'd never believe it.</i>

562
00:28:37,225 --> 00:28:39,436
<i>The short one's Iceland.</i>

563
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:42,439
Iceland. I didn't know
anyone came from Iceland.

564
00:28:42,522 --> 00:28:44,858
Thought it was just a block of ice.

565
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:47,277
<i>- It's very green, actually.</i>
- Really?

566
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,780
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
- I thought that was Greenland.

567
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:51,823
<i>No. Greenland's very icy.</i>

568
00:28:51,907 --> 00:28:54,493
<i>Iceland's very green.</i>

569
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:58,455
<i>They switched names to fool the Vikings,
who were trying to steal their women.</i>

570
00:28:58,538 --> 00:28:59,706
Oh, I see.

571
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,709
No. <i>Blue</i> sea.

572
00:29:02,793 --> 00:29:04,753
- Red sea.
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

573
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:06,379
<i>No red.</i>

574
00:29:06,463 --> 00:29:09,591
- You're a painter.
<i>- How did you guess?</i>

575
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:14,012
So, what movie did David go to see?

576
00:29:14,095 --> 00:29:17,891
<i>Um, he went to the Rialto in Pasadena.
He always goes there.</i>

577
00:29:17,974 --> 00:29:19,768
What's showing?

578
00:29:19,851 --> 00:29:22,729
<i>Urn,</i> Bicycle Thief, <i>I think.</i>

579
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,566
It's a good movie.
Have you seen it?

580
00:29:27,776 --> 00:29:30,070
<i>No, I don't go to the movies.</i>

581
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:32,155
You don't? Why not?

582
00:29:33,198 --> 00:29:35,742
Oh...

583
00:29:39,412 --> 00:29:41,039
Life is too short.

584
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:43,708
<i>I've gotta hang up now.</i>

585
00:31:09,502 --> 00:31:11,421
David Kahane.

586
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,673
No, you have the wrong guy, man.

587
00:31:30,357 --> 00:31:32,901
- Wow. You didn't like it?
- It's a foreign film.

588
00:31:34,861 --> 00:31:36,988
David Kahane.

589
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:38,698
Griffin Mill.

590
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:41,618
Griffin Mill.

591
00:31:41,701 --> 00:31:43,286
Yeah?

592
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,372
Great movie, huh?

593
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:47,374
So refreshing to see something like this

594
00:31:47,457 --> 00:31:52,379
after all these cop movies
and, you know, things we do.

595
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,882
Maybe we'll do a remake of this.

596
00:31:55,966 --> 00:31:59,303
- You'd probably give it a happy ending.
- Oh, no, no. We'd keep it pure.

597
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:01,304
Pure, right.

598
00:32:01,388 --> 00:32:02,973
You wanna write it?

599
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,184
- Don't fuck with me, Mill.
- I'm not fucking with you.

600
00:32:06,267 --> 00:32:09,938
- I said I'd get back to you, didn't I?
- Yeah. About six months ago.

601
00:32:10,021 --> 00:32:12,471
- I thought you'd forgotten.
- And you were angry.

602
00:32:14,150 --> 00:32:15,568
Maybe.

603
00:32:15,652 --> 00:32:17,028
Do you wanna talk about it?

604
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:20,573
- Okay, sure.
- Great.

605
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:23,827
Let's let the studio buy us a drink.

606
00:32:26,287 --> 00:32:30,167
Well, if you don't mind a place where you
don't have any suck with the maître d',

607
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,002
I know a bar down the street.

608
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:33,503
Let's go.

609
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:43,054
Have you ever been to Japan?

610
00:32:43,138 --> 00:32:47,225
Yes, uh, I was there once
on a location scout with Steven Spielberg.

611
00:32:47,308 --> 00:32:49,894
I lived there for a year.

612
00:32:49,978 --> 00:32:52,188
- Student year abroad.
- Great.

613
00:32:52,272 --> 00:32:54,858
You know, I-I wish I'd done that.

614
00:32:54,941 --> 00:32:58,361
Well, I think about it a lot.
I'll never forget it.

615
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:00,947
You should write about it.

616
00:33:01,031 --> 00:33:03,324
I did. Don't you remember?

617
00:33:04,784 --> 00:33:06,327
What?

618
00:33:07,412 --> 00:33:08,830
<i>Arigato.</i>

619
00:33:08,913 --> 00:33:12,625
My idea about the American student
that goes to Ja — Japan.

620
00:33:13,793 --> 00:33:16,964
That was my pitch, the one you were
supposed to get back to me on.

621
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:19,215
You don't remember, do you?

622
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:21,051
Of course I remember.

623
00:33:22,552 --> 00:33:25,680
- You never got back to me.
- Listen.

624
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:29,934
I was an asshole. All right?

625
00:33:30,018 --> 00:33:32,312
It comes with the job.

626
00:33:32,395 --> 00:33:34,397
I'm sorry. I really am.

627
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:39,986
I know how angry you must've been,
and I'll make it up to you.

00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,654
That's what I'm here for.

- You still wanna buy my story?
- I told you I'd give you a deal.

659
00:35:47,947 --> 00:35:50,787
Stop by the studio first thing in the
morning. We'll work something out.

660
00:35:50,825 --> 00:35:53,369
And who will I ask for?

661
00:35:53,453 --> 00:35:54,996
Larry Levy?

662
00:35:57,081 --> 00:36:00,877
What's Larry Levy got to do with this?
How do you know about Larry Levy?

663
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,713
Don't you read the trades?
<i>New York Times</i> business section?

664
00:36:03,796 --> 00:36:05,715
He's moving in.
You're moving out.

665
00:36:05,798 --> 00:36:08,385
You can't make a deal.
That's what they say. Yesterday's news.

666
00:36:08,468 --> 00:36:10,678
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

667
00:36:11,804 --> 00:36:14,432
Can I borrow your mobile phone?
Huh?

668
00:36:14,515 --> 00:36:17,936
Uh, Larry Levy.
Yeah, Larry, David Kahane here.

669
00:36:18,019 --> 00:36:22,065
Listen, Larry, guess who's making promises
about getting pictures made

670
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:24,734
to writers in parking lots?

671
00:36:24,817 --> 00:36:27,820
Guess what dumb son of a bitch executive

672
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:31,199
is trying to take advantage of — of me?

673
00:36:31,908 --> 00:36:34,827
I mean, do you realize
how unstoppable this guy is?

674
00:36:35,828 --> 00:36:39,707
You know, I cannot wait to tell the world

675
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:43,336
that when Griffin Mill
can't cut the pressure at work,

676
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:46,214
he drives out to Pasadena

677
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:49,467
to pick fights with writers!

678
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,845
You tell Larry Levy to give me a call.

679
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:57,934
The word is out that he's gonna start making
meaningful pictures at the studio for a change.

680
00:36:58,017 --> 00:37:01,271
All right, let's — let's forget this.
So just stop all the postcard shit!

681
00:37:01,354 --> 00:37:03,690
I don't write postcards!
I write scripts!

682
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:07,151
- We're both wrong, okay?
- No, <i>you're</i> wrong, buddy!

683
00:37:07,235 --> 00:37:09,863
You're in over your head.
That's why you're losing your job.

684
00:37:09,946 --> 00:37:13,032
And then what are you gonna do. Huh?

685
00:37:13,116 --> 00:37:15,576
I can write.
What can you do?

686
00:37:20,081 --> 00:37:22,083
I said let's forget this.

687
00:37:27,213 --> 00:37:29,382
Aw, shit.

688
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:33,469
Mill, you okay?

689
00:37:33,553 --> 00:37:35,138
You all right?

690
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:43,563
Keep it to yourself!

691
00:37:44,981 --> 00:37:47,150
Keep it to yourself!

692
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,402
Keep it to yourself.

693
00:38:13,259 --> 00:38:14,761
Kahane?

694
00:39:35,174 --> 00:39:37,135
<i>You know what's interesting.</i>

695
00:39:37,218 --> 00:39:39,429
<i>I mean, who —
Who's writing this new ending?</i>

696
00:39:39,512 --> 00:39:41,931
<i>Who wrote the new ending
of</i> Fatal Attraction? <i>The audience.</i>

697
00:39:42,014 --> 00:39:43,433
<i>In that case —</i>

698
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:45,477
<i>A million-plus screenwriters,
and the audience wrote that ending.</i>

699
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,397
<i>Yes, but who's to say what it would have
done if you had left the original ending?</i>

700
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,399
<i>- You can't say.
- You're right. You can't say.</i>

701
00:39:51,482 --> 00:39:54,027
<i>But you</i> can <i>say that it's done
almost 300 million worldwide</i>

702
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:56,960
<i>with the ending that was selected
from the test screening.</i>

703
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,325
Larry Levy, I don't believe that you've
met my assistant, Whitney Gersh.

704
00:40:00,408 --> 00:40:02,577
- No, I haven't.
- It's a great pleasure to meet you.

705
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,079
Nice to meet you, Whitney.

706
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:07,082
- What are you doing?
- Bonnie, how's your picture doing?

707
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:09,084
- It just tested last week.
- It's doing well.

708
00:40:09,167 --> 00:40:10,585
- How well?
- It was our first test.

709
00:40:10,668 --> 00:40:13,212
- Were you breathing hard?
- Excuse me, Walter.

710
00:40:13,296 --> 00:40:17,800
Um, Joel, Griffin still isn't in, but I
really think we have to start this meeting.

711
00:40:17,884 --> 00:40:20,052
Okay, Celia. Thank you.

712
00:40:22,722 --> 00:40:25,057
You remember a movie called <i>DOA?</i>

713
00:40:25,141 --> 00:40:27,393
Sure I do.
Eddie O'Brien and Pam Britton.

714
00:40:27,477 --> 00:40:30,646
Disney did a remake in '87 or '88.

715
00:40:30,730 --> 00:40:33,650
Yeah, well, I think we got pretty much
the same situation here.

716
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:35,943
Keep our noses clean, Walter.

717
00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:38,112
I can see you're flush.

718
00:40:40,198 --> 00:40:43,117
It's a shame to waste the picture.
It's a great picture.

719
00:40:43,201 --> 00:40:46,579
Who said we're wasting the picture?
Where did that come from?

720
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:49,582
You know what's interesting.
We're all too busy to go see movies.

721
00:40:49,665 --> 00:40:52,502
Griffin, you're really late.
They're, like, waiting inside.

722
00:40:52,585 --> 00:40:54,712
- Here's your meeting agenda.
- You oughta try it sometime.

723
00:40:54,795 --> 00:40:57,715
Actually rub shoulders
with the great unwashed.

724
00:40:57,798 --> 00:41:01,177
We need to give them
the kind of pictures they want,

725
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:03,388
not the kind these writers
want to give them.

726
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:06,807
I know you guys spend
a lot of time with writers.

727
00:41:06,891 --> 00:41:10,686
Believe me, you have
my deepest sympathy, but...

728
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,898
- Hello. Sorry I'm late.
- You certainly are.

729
00:41:15,233 --> 00:41:17,735
- Jan, talk to you for a minute, please?
- Yeah.

730
00:41:17,818 --> 00:41:21,114
- Just a couple minutes in your office is fine.
- Sure. How you doing?

731
00:41:21,197 --> 00:41:23,575
Griffin, you missed the formal
welcoming ceremony this morning.

732
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:25,409
You know Larry Levy.

733
00:41:26,577 --> 00:41:27,995
Of course.

734
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,623
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Griffin.

735
00:41:30,706 --> 00:41:33,376
Larry was able to get out of Fox
a week earlier than he thought

736
00:41:33,459 --> 00:41:35,586
and has come aboard as of this morning.

737
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:38,214
Great. Let's, uh — Let's start.

738
00:41:39,382 --> 00:41:41,634
In fact, Larry was just
in the middle of something.

739
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:43,887
Oh, no. I wasn't. I was just
killing time waiting for Griffin.

740
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,888
Oh. Well, no. Finish.

741
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:47,890
What were you saying?

742
00:41:47,974 --> 00:41:51,728
I was just saying that I've yet to meet a
writer who could change water into wine,

743
00:41:51,811 --> 00:41:54,772
and we have a tendency
to treat them like that.

744
00:41:54,855 --> 00:41:57,316
Not at this studio.

745
00:41:57,858 --> 00:41:59,986
A million, million and a half
for these scripts.

746
00:42:00,069 --> 00:42:02,113
It's — It's nuts.

747
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:04,532
And I think avoidable.

748
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:06,033
Let me ask you something.

749
00:42:06,117 --> 00:42:08,286
When was the last time
you bought a ticket to see a movie?

750
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:11,372
- You actually paid your own money to see it?
- Last night.

751
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:14,500
In Pasadena.
<i>The Bicycle Thief.</i>

752
00:42:14,584 --> 00:42:18,129
- You went to see <i>The Bicycle Thief?</i>
- I love that film. It's a great film.

753
00:42:18,212 --> 00:42:21,758
It's an art movie. It doesn't count.
We're talking about "movie" movies.

754
00:42:21,841 --> 00:42:23,301
Jesus, people.

755
00:42:23,384 --> 00:42:25,845
All I'm saying is, there's a lot
of time and money to be saved

756
00:42:25,928 --> 00:42:28,681
if we came up
with these stories on our own.

757
00:42:28,764 --> 00:42:30,683
Where are these stories
coming from, Larry?

758
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:33,019
Anywhere. Anywhere.
It doesn't matter. Anywhere.

759
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:35,938
The newspaper.
Pick a story. Any story.

760
00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:37,565
All right.

761
00:42:39,442 --> 00:42:42,612
"Immigrants Protest Budget Cuts
in Literacy Program."

762
00:42:42,695 --> 00:42:46,157
Human spirit overcoming economic adversity.
Sounds like Horatio Alger in the barrio.

763
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,952
Put Jimmy Smits in it and you got
a sexy <i>Stand and Deliver.</i> Next.

764
00:42:50,036 --> 00:42:52,413
- Come on.
- Larry, this isn't my field.

765
00:42:52,496 --> 00:42:55,458
Marty, it doesn't matter.
Just give it a shot. You can't lose here.

766
00:42:55,541 --> 00:42:58,127
Okay.

767
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:02,381
How about, uh,
"Mud Slide Kills 60 in Slums of Chile."

768
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:06,260
That's good. Triumph over tragedy.
Sounds like a John Boorman picture.

769
00:43:06,344 --> 00:43:09,347
Slap a happy ending on it,
the script will write itself.

770
00:43:09,430 --> 00:43:11,057
Bon. Here, give me the paper.

771
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,434
Gee, I don't know, <i>Lar.</i>

772
00:43:13,517 --> 00:43:15,227
Give it a shot.

773
00:43:16,937 --> 00:43:20,358
"Further Bond Losses
Push Dow Down 7.15."

774
00:43:21,192 --> 00:43:23,152
I see Connery as Bond.

775
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:26,195
That's funny. It's a good thing
Oliver Stone wasn't listening to you.

776
00:43:26,238 --> 00:43:27,740
Where would we have been?

777
00:43:27,823 --> 00:43:30,743
Well, we all would have been
spared having to sit through <i>Wall Street.</i>

778
00:43:30,826 --> 00:43:33,162
Marty, what did <i>Wall Street</i> do worldwide?

779
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,665
Seventy, 75, maybe 80.

780
00:43:35,748 --> 00:43:39,126
Eighty million dollars,
a couple of Oscars — nothing to sneeze at.

781
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:42,254
I think Larry's point is well taken.
Let's move on now.

782
00:43:42,338 --> 00:43:45,788
Griffin, uh, can you give us an update
on the Taylor Hackford project?

783
00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:48,678
Griffin?

784
00:43:48,761 --> 00:43:50,304
Yeah.

785
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:54,016
I was just thinking
what an interesting concept it is

786
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,270
to eliminate the writer
from the artistic process.

787
00:43:59,355 --> 00:44:03,405
If we can just get rid of these actors and
directors, maybe we got something here.

788
00:44:09,615 --> 00:44:11,283
Hello, Walter.

789
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,369
Make yourself at home.

790
00:44:13,452 --> 00:44:17,456
Mr. Mill, I understand you were
kinda late coming in this morning.

791
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,542
You all right?

792
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,252
I'm fine.

793
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:23,129
Appreciate your concern.

794
00:44:24,964 --> 00:44:27,341
What can I do for you, Walter?

795
00:44:27,425 --> 00:44:30,636
Don't tell me you came here
to pitch me a story.

796
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,389
That's exactly what I've come to do.

797
00:44:33,472 --> 00:44:36,684
It's a good one too.
It's about a writer. Sort of.

798
00:44:36,767 --> 00:44:38,436
David Kahane.

799
00:44:41,105 --> 00:44:43,357
David Kahane.
Who's David Kahane?

800
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:44,900
Oh, you met him.

801
00:44:45,818 --> 00:44:48,154
- Well, I meet a lot of writers.
- Uh-huh.

802
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:50,717
But this particular writer that you met
was murdered last night

803
00:44:50,781 --> 00:44:52,867
in back of the Rialto theater in Pasadena.

804
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,493
Murdered?

805
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:58,664
Oh, come to think of it,
Pasadena's as good a place to die as any.

806
00:45:00,207 --> 00:45:01,917
So, what's the story?

807
00:45:02,001 --> 00:45:04,003
Twenty-five words or less?

808
00:45:04,086 --> 00:45:05,963
Okay.

809
00:45:06,046 --> 00:45:08,966
Movie exec calls writer. Writer's
girlfriend says he's at the movies.

810
00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:12,261
Exec goes to the movies,
meets writer, drinks with writer.

811
00:45:12,344 --> 00:45:15,848
Writer gets conked and dies
in four inches of dirty water.

812
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:18,392
Movie exec is in deep shit.

813
00:45:19,518 --> 00:45:21,479
What do you think?

814
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,272
That's more than 25 words.

815
00:45:23,355 --> 00:45:25,065
And it's bullshit.

816
00:45:25,691 --> 00:45:27,819
Yeah, well, Pasadena homicide
doesn't think it's bullshit.

817
00:45:27,902 --> 00:45:29,862
They got a complete report.

818
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:33,116
You met Kahane at the Rialto. You got
drunk with him at a Japanese restaurant.

819
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:36,619
He left before you did.
That's the last time anyone saw him alive.

820
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:38,662
Except you, maybe.

821
00:45:38,746 --> 00:45:41,457
Why are you denying this?

822
00:45:43,209 --> 00:45:45,211
What do the police think?

823
00:45:45,294 --> 00:45:48,047
They think it's a botched robbery.

824
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,050
You know,
the window of his car was busted.

825
00:45:51,133 --> 00:45:54,595
He surprised someone
trying to take the radio.

826
00:45:54,678 --> 00:45:57,056
There was a fight.
He was killed.

827
00:45:57,139 --> 00:45:59,141
I didn't kill him, Walter.

828
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:02,770
But I went to see him.

829
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:04,855
I know I said I didn't, but I did.

830
00:46:04,939 --> 00:46:06,982
Why'd you lie to me?

831
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:10,861
Well... now's not
a very good time for me.

832
00:46:10,945 --> 00:46:13,739
Haven't you heard the rumors?
I'm on my way out.

833
00:46:14,657 --> 00:46:17,326
Just what I need —
A little more controversy.

834
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,411
This is not a good time, Walter.

835
00:46:20,704 --> 00:46:26,544
Look, I am in charge of studio security
in every definition of the word,

836
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:30,047
which means it is my job
to take care of a studio executive,

837
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:33,843
should he be, uh, shall we say,
under suspicion of murder

838
00:46:33,926 --> 00:46:38,222
at a time when profits are down and
the company is vulnerable for a takeover.

839
00:46:38,305 --> 00:46:41,475
It is my job to keep this
very, very, very, very quiet!

840
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:44,937
Do you wanna help?

841
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:47,898
- Of course.
- Then stop lying.

842
00:46:47,982 --> 00:46:50,609
- How many meetings you have with this guy?
- One.

843
00:46:51,652 --> 00:46:53,780
- Not counting last night?
- Not counting last night.

844
00:46:53,863 --> 00:46:56,657
Why'd you go all the way
to Pasadena to meet him?

845
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,660
He had an idea I was interested in.
I wanted to talk to him right away.

846
00:46:59,743 --> 00:47:02,330
His girlfriend. I guess
she was a friend of yours too.

847
00:47:02,413 --> 00:47:03,998
Think fast!

848
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:07,209
Jesus Christ, Walter,
what do you think? What is this?

849
00:47:07,293 --> 00:47:10,463
It's the third degree. If you don't like it,
wait till the police start asking questions.

850
00:47:10,546 --> 00:47:14,008
- They'll be a lot less polite than I am!
- I'll go to the police! You come with me!

851
00:47:14,091 --> 00:47:16,385
Now you're acting
like someone's who's guilty.

852
00:47:16,468 --> 00:47:18,429
You're not guilty, are you?

853
00:47:18,512 --> 00:47:20,723
For the last time, I'm not a murderer.

854
00:47:38,073 --> 00:47:39,825
Bad news?

855
00:47:39,909 --> 00:47:41,493
What?

856
00:47:41,577 --> 00:47:44,163
The fax. Is it bad news?

857
00:47:44,246 --> 00:47:45,497
No.

858
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:48,542
Business as usual.

859
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:53,839
The Hollywood system
did not murder David Kahane.

860
00:47:53,923 --> 00:47:57,051
Not the 98-million-dollar movie.
Not the 12-million-dollar actor.

861
00:47:57,134 --> 00:48:02,139
Not even the million-dollar deal
that David Kahane never landed.

862
00:48:02,973 --> 00:48:05,809
No, the most that we can pin on Hollywood

863
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:08,562
is assault with intent to kill.

864
00:48:09,563 --> 00:48:14,401
Because society is responsible
for this particular murder,

865
00:48:14,485 --> 00:48:16,695
and it is to society that we must look

866
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:20,282
if we are to have any justice
for that crime.

867
00:48:20,366 --> 00:48:23,285
Because someone in the night

868
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:25,329
killed David Kahane,

869
00:48:25,412 --> 00:48:27,998
and that person
will have to bear the guilt.

870
00:48:29,333 --> 00:48:32,002
And if, uh, David were here right now,

871
00:48:32,086 --> 00:48:34,686
I know in my heart that —
That he — h-he would say...

872
00:48:36,006 --> 00:48:38,676
"Cut the shit, Phil.

873
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:42,259
What did you learn from all of this?
Did you learn anything from this?"

874
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:45,975
And I'd say, "Uh, yeah, David,
uh, I've learned a lot.

875
00:48:46,058 --> 00:48:49,144
We here, uh, we'll take it from here."

876
00:48:49,228 --> 00:48:52,690
And the next time we sell
a script for a million dollars,

877
00:48:53,482 --> 00:48:56,944
the next time we nail some
shit-bag producer to the wall, we'll say,

878
00:48:57,027 --> 00:48:59,029
"That's another one
for David Kahane!"

879
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:04,952
David was working on something
the day he died.

880
00:49:05,035 --> 00:49:07,579
I'd like to share it with you.

881
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:09,790
"Blackness.

882
00:49:09,873 --> 00:49:11,375
A mangy dog barks.

883
00:49:12,084 --> 00:49:16,422
Garbage can lids are lifted
as derelicts in the streets hunt for food.

884
00:49:17,256 --> 00:49:19,758
Buzzing, as a cheap alarm clock goes off.

885
00:49:19,842 --> 00:49:23,345
Interior. Flophouse room.
Early morning.

886
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:26,557
A tracking shot moves
through the grimy room.

887
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:30,185
Light streams in through holes
in the yellowing window shades.

888
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:33,022
Moths dance in the beams of light.

889
00:49:33,105 --> 00:49:36,358
Track down along the floor.
The frayed rug.

890
00:49:36,442 --> 00:49:39,236
Stop on an old shoe.

891
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:41,321
It's empty."

892
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:47,661
That's as far as he got.

893
00:49:48,787 --> 00:49:50,998
That's the last thing he wrote.

894
00:49:52,291 --> 00:49:54,543
So long, Dave.

895
00:49:54,626 --> 00:49:56,712
Fade out.

896
00:49:56,795 --> 00:49:58,338
Thank you.

897
00:50:14,313 --> 00:50:17,316
Who are you?
You're not a writer.

898
00:50:18,734 --> 00:50:21,111
No, I-I'm — I'm G — I'm Griffin Mill.

899
00:50:21,195 --> 00:50:22,905
- We spoke the night David wa —
- Oh.

900
00:50:22,988 --> 00:50:25,908
Blue sea, white sea.

901
00:50:25,991 --> 00:50:28,368
- It turned out you were right.
- What?

902
00:50:28,452 --> 00:50:30,788
It was a red sea.

903
00:50:30,871 --> 00:50:32,998
Oh. Yeah.

904
00:50:34,958 --> 00:50:38,087
You're the only person I know here.

905
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:41,173
Listen, I'm really sorry about David.

906
00:50:41,256 --> 00:50:44,593
He was, uh... a talent.

907
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:47,930
You really think so?

908
00:50:48,013 --> 00:50:50,432
I always suspected he was...

909
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:53,852
uniquely untalented.

910
00:50:55,395 --> 00:50:57,732
But it's nice of you to say that.
It's nice of you to come.

911
00:50:57,815 --> 00:51:00,192
- Really, you didn't have to.
- Well, I did.

912
00:51:00,275 --> 00:51:04,321
You know, I was probably
the last person to see him alive.

913
00:51:04,404 --> 00:51:06,949
Yeah. The police told me.

914
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:09,076
Well, not quite the last, surely.

915
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:10,702
No.

916
00:51:12,454 --> 00:51:15,499
I'm sure this is a terrible time for you.

917
00:51:15,582 --> 00:51:17,960
Is there anything you need or...

918
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:20,212
No, really. I...

919
00:51:20,295 --> 00:51:22,756
I don't feel bad.

920
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,050
It's like when my parents died. I...

921
00:51:25,884 --> 00:51:27,970
I didn't feel anything at all.

922
00:51:28,053 --> 00:51:29,638
They were just gone.

923
00:51:31,014 --> 00:51:34,101
Well, I'm sure it hasn't sunk in yet.

924
00:51:34,184 --> 00:51:36,061
That was years ago.

925
00:51:36,145 --> 00:51:38,397
- No, I meant David.
- Oh.

926
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:40,816
Oh, God.

927
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:43,318
These people.
I don't like it here.

928
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:46,989
They're all expecting me
to grieve and mourn, and...

929
00:51:47,781 --> 00:51:49,658
I can't talk to them.

930
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,245
David's gone and...

931
00:51:54,246 --> 00:51:56,790
I'm somewhere else already.

932
00:51:56,874 --> 00:51:59,042
- Will you take me home?
- What?

933
00:51:59,835 --> 00:52:01,837
Will you take me home?

934
00:52:02,671 --> 00:52:04,006
Sure.

935
00:52:04,089 --> 00:52:05,632
I'm right here.

936
00:52:42,377 --> 00:52:45,047
These are very interesting.
I like them.

937
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,840
Would you like a drink?

938
00:52:46,924 --> 00:52:48,884
No, thanks.

939
00:52:48,967 --> 00:52:51,053
- Where do you show?
- Hmm?

940
00:52:51,136 --> 00:52:52,888
Gallery. What gallery?
Who's your dealer?

941
00:52:52,971 --> 00:52:55,224
I don't have a dealer.

942
00:52:55,307 --> 00:52:57,684
I couldn't sell these.
They're never finished.

943
00:52:57,768 --> 00:52:59,937
Biccy?

944
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,355
No, thanks.

945
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:02,898
They're never finished?

946
00:53:02,981 --> 00:53:05,567
No, they're just what I do.

947
00:53:05,651 --> 00:53:07,402
For myself.

948
00:53:07,486 --> 00:53:09,029
What I feel.

949
00:53:10,197 --> 00:53:12,866
You ask lots of questions, Mr. Mill.

950
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:14,409
Just like the police.

951
00:53:14,493 --> 00:53:16,870
That's all they did.
Ask questions.

952
00:53:18,413 --> 00:53:20,207
They asked me a lot about you.

953
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,167
- Did they?
- Mm-hmm.

954
00:53:22,251 --> 00:53:26,088
How long we've known each other,
if you'd ever been to the house before.

955
00:53:26,171 --> 00:53:29,174
Well, I suppose they have to
ask those questions.

956
00:53:29,258 --> 00:53:31,134
I don't see why.

957
00:53:31,218 --> 00:53:33,220
'Cause that's what police do.

958
00:53:34,388 --> 00:53:36,515
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

959
00:53:37,683 --> 00:53:41,561
Why was it so important to see David
that night? What was so urgent?

960
00:53:44,189 --> 00:53:46,858
Well, he pitched me a story
a few months ago and...

961
00:53:46,942 --> 00:53:49,403
- The Japan story, right?
- Yes. The Japan story.

962
00:53:49,486 --> 00:53:53,240
I liked it at the time, but it
needed work, especially the ending.

963
00:53:53,323 --> 00:53:55,909
I was sitting in my office that day

964
00:53:55,993 --> 00:53:59,121
and it suddenly occurred to me
how to make the ending work.

965
00:53:59,204 --> 00:54:01,373
So, what was it?

966
00:54:01,456 --> 00:54:04,459
- What?
- Your idea for the ending.

967
00:54:05,836 --> 00:54:08,005
Up.

968
00:54:08,088 --> 00:54:09,464
- Up?
- Up.

969
00:54:09,548 --> 00:54:11,967
- What does that mean?
- As opposed to down. Moods.

970
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:14,511
- Oh.
- You know, happy as opposed to sad.

971
00:54:14,594 --> 00:54:16,388
Hopeful as opposed to depressing.

972
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:20,100
- What did you think of his ending?
- I never read it.

973
00:54:21,852 --> 00:54:24,646
- You never read it?
- Nope.

974
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,898
I don't like reading.

975
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:28,567
Do you like books?

976
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:30,319
I like words.

977
00:54:30,402 --> 00:54:32,154
And letters.

978
00:54:32,237 --> 00:54:34,740
But I'm not crazy
about complete sentences.

979
00:54:34,823 --> 00:54:36,450
Hmm.

980
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:38,076
So, what did he think?

981
00:54:39,077 --> 00:54:42,831
He walked out on me, actually.
I don't think David liked me very much.

982
00:54:42,914 --> 00:54:46,918
I think he just didn't like happy endings.

983
00:54:50,672 --> 00:54:52,424
Put your face here.

984
00:54:54,134 --> 00:54:55,677
Great.

985
00:54:57,846 --> 00:55:00,349
What are you doing?
You're not going to paint me, are you?

986
00:55:00,432 --> 00:55:03,810
I might put you in one of my paintings.

987
00:55:03,894 --> 00:55:07,439
There's one that I want to do
of an Icelandic hero.

988
00:55:07,522 --> 00:55:10,609
He's a thief and he's made of fire.

989
00:55:10,692 --> 00:55:13,278
- But you might not like that.
- Why not?

990
00:55:13,987 --> 00:55:15,906
Because you're in the movies.

991
00:55:15,989 --> 00:55:20,035
And in the movies you can't have
thieves as heroes, can you?

992
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:21,370
Oh, I don't know about that.

993
00:55:21,453 --> 00:55:24,247
We have a long tradition
of gangsters in the movies.

994
00:55:24,331 --> 00:55:27,731
Oh, yes, but they always have to
suffer for their crimes, don't they?

995
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,255
Well, we should pay for our crimes,
shouldn't we?

996
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:35,488
Oh, I don't know. I think knowing that
you've committed a crime is suffering enough.

997
00:55:36,218 --> 00:55:40,389
If you don't suffer,
then maybe it wasn't a crime after all.

998
00:55:41,473 --> 00:55:44,101
Anyway, what difference does it make?

999
00:55:44,184 --> 00:55:47,479
It has nothing to do
with how things really are.

1000
00:55:51,566 --> 00:55:53,485
You don't really believe that, do you?

1001
00:55:53,568 --> 00:55:56,822
I don't know what I believe, Mr. Mill.

1002
00:55:57,864 --> 00:56:00,826
It's just what I feel.

1003
00:56:02,327 --> 00:56:05,330
You know what you are,
June whatever your name is?

1004
00:56:06,456 --> 00:56:07,999
You're a pragmatic anarchist.

1005
00:56:09,292 --> 00:56:11,420
- Is that what I am?
- That's what you are.

1006
00:56:11,503 --> 00:56:13,630
I never was sure.

1007
00:56:18,093 --> 00:56:21,096
Could I just pick this up? Yeah?

1008
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,265
Oh. It's heavy. Ooh.

1009
00:56:23,348 --> 00:56:26,935
- Thirty-seven ounces.
- Really? Oh, look, look.

1010
00:56:27,018 --> 00:56:31,314
I wanna thank my mother, and her mother,
and her father's mother, who was the...

1011
00:56:32,399 --> 00:56:34,067
Hello.

1012
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:35,986
Hello.

1013
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:37,946
- Meet Detective Susan Avery.
- How do you do?

1014
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:39,589
- Hello, Detective.
- Sorry. My partner.

1015
00:56:39,656 --> 00:56:41,283
- Willa Broom.
- My pleasure.

1016
00:56:41,366 --> 00:56:42,784
Let's go in here.

1017
00:56:42,868 --> 00:56:45,788
This is the first real movie studio
Detective Avery's been to.

1018
00:56:45,871 --> 00:56:48,415
- Oh, really?
- Well, aside from the Universal Tour.

1019
00:56:48,498 --> 00:56:51,418
You know, when my family comes in,
I always take 'em out there.

1020
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:54,963
Been out there so often I kinda
feel like I'm ready to direct.

1021
00:56:55,046 --> 00:56:57,800
Well, you'd probably
do better than most of the film grads

1022
00:56:57,883 --> 00:56:59,802
they're handing the cameras
out to nowadays.

1023
00:56:59,885 --> 00:57:02,471
I'm sorry I didn't call you
when I heard Kahane was dead.

1024
00:57:02,554 --> 00:57:04,097
- Heard or read?
- Read.

1025
00:57:04,181 --> 00:57:05,932
Why didn't you?

1026
00:57:06,016 --> 00:57:09,103
Walter asked me the same question
and I wish I had a better answer for it,

1027
00:57:09,186 --> 00:57:11,938
but all I can say
is that I didn't think about it.

1028
00:57:12,022 --> 00:57:13,523
Mmm.

1029
00:57:14,316 --> 00:57:16,526
How did you know where he was gonna be?

1030
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:18,904
His wife told me he was seeing
<i>The Bicycle Thief.</i>

1031
00:57:18,987 --> 00:57:20,822
His girlfriend.

1032
00:57:20,906 --> 00:57:22,365
Girlfriend.

1033
00:57:22,449 --> 00:57:24,368
Girlfriend.
I didn't know either of them.

1034
00:57:24,451 --> 00:57:27,079
I was feeling restless,
so I thought I'd go see the movie,

1035
00:57:27,162 --> 00:57:30,332
and if he was there I was gonna talk to
him about a job I thought he was good for.

1036
00:57:30,415 --> 00:57:32,876
So you got to the theater,
you saw him and...

1037
00:57:32,959 --> 00:57:35,879
We went and had a drink
at a Japanese place he knew about.

1038
00:57:35,962 --> 00:57:39,257
It was a wild, incredible scene.
It was like Tokyo.

1039
00:57:39,341 --> 00:57:42,385
But he left before you did.
Why didn't you leave together?

1040
00:57:42,469 --> 00:57:45,109
Like I said, it was an incredible scene.
I was having a great time.

1041
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,015
Then why didn't you stay longer?

1042
00:57:47,098 --> 00:57:51,311
Well, the people stopped singing and
then it was just a bar, and I don't drink.

1043
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:52,729
Drank with him.

1044
00:57:52,812 --> 00:57:54,314
Well, when in Rome.

1045
00:57:54,397 --> 00:57:56,858
- Did you know him socially?
- No.

1046
00:57:56,942 --> 00:57:58,360
- Been to his house?
- No.

1047
00:57:58,443 --> 00:58:00,487
Know anything about him personally?

1048
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:02,322
- No.
- Griffin.

1049
00:58:02,405 --> 00:58:05,408
Guess we're gonna let you
get back to work now.

1050
00:58:07,786 --> 00:58:09,788
Something's bothering you.
What is it?

1051
00:58:09,871 --> 00:58:12,624
Well, I — I just have to ask you.

1052
00:58:12,707 --> 00:58:16,711
D-Did you see him
in the parking lot after you left?

1053
00:58:16,795 --> 00:58:18,630
No. I parked on the street.

1054
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:21,925
I drive a Range Rover,
so I always feel safer when it's visible.

1055
00:58:22,008 --> 00:58:24,427
Out on the street,
who's gonna smash a window?

1056
00:58:24,511 --> 00:58:25,929
Mmm.

1057
00:58:26,012 --> 00:58:29,141
You mean, if you had a shitty car, you
would've been parked in the parking lot?

1058
00:58:29,224 --> 00:58:32,143
If I had a shitty car,
I might be a dead man.

1059
00:58:32,811 --> 00:58:36,481
Somehow I think you're a little
too lucky for that. Thank you.

1060
00:58:36,565 --> 00:58:37,983
<i>Okay.</i>

1061
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:41,016
<i>- Come on. Wait one second.
- Sixty-three, take three, mark.</i>

1062
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:42,779
<i>Now.</i>

1063
00:58:43,446 --> 00:58:45,031
<i>Action!</i>

1064
00:58:46,741 --> 00:58:49,077
<i>No, goddamn it, Peterson,
you listen to me.</i>

1065
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,581
<i>I been around a while. I got a nose.
This situation stinks.</i>

1066
00:58:52,664 --> 00:58:54,666
<i>It stinks of the Company.</i>

1067
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:57,669
<i>That's right, Peterson, the fucking CIA.
You ever heard of it?</i>

1068
00:58:57,752 --> 00:58:59,171
Lily understands what I'm talking about.

1069
00:58:59,254 --> 00:59:01,173
<i>It's just the kind of operation
those whiz kid fucks —</i>

1070
00:59:01,256 --> 00:59:03,675
- You don't understand what he's trying for here.
- I guess I don't.

1071
00:59:03,758 --> 00:59:07,346
I find it hard to listen to your argument
when you don't understand what he's going for.

1072
00:59:07,429 --> 00:59:09,515
<i>- Would you shut up, please?
- Oh, kiss my ass.</i>

1073
00:59:09,598 --> 00:59:12,059
I'd be surprised if anybody understood
because you can't even see anything.

1074
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:15,270
<i>I have to cut because my robe caught
on the drawer here. I couldn't help it.</i>

1075
00:59:15,353 --> 00:59:16,793
<i>- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I'm sorry.</i>

1076
00:59:16,855 --> 00:59:18,690
- I like this guy.
- Scotty Glenn? He's great.

1077
00:59:18,773 --> 00:59:21,610
- What kind of water is it?
- It's, um, Spa.

1078
00:59:21,693 --> 00:59:23,653
Can I have some Volvic, please?

1079
00:59:23,737 --> 00:59:26,323
<i>Action!</i>

1080
00:59:26,406 --> 00:59:27,824
<i>No, goddamn it, Peterson.</i>

1081
00:59:27,907 --> 00:59:30,202
I heard the police came
to see you about this dead writer.

1082
00:59:30,285 --> 00:59:31,870
Who was this guy?

1083
00:59:31,953 --> 00:59:33,955
His name was David Kahane.

1084
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:37,000
I never heard of him.
Did we ever hire him for anything?

1085
00:59:37,083 --> 00:59:40,211
I was thinking about it.

1086
00:59:40,295 --> 00:59:43,506
He pitched me a story.
I went out there to talk to him about it.

1087
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,717
Jesus. Poor bastard.

1088
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,388
Just when his ship is about to come in,
some black kid steals his money for crack.

1089
00:59:49,471 --> 00:59:52,057
<i>I don't want to criticize you, babe,</i>

1090
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,351
<i>but I'm supposed to be having
a conversation on the phone.</i>

1091
00:59:54,434 --> 00:59:57,312
<i>- Are you talking to me?</i>
- Are the cops bothering you?

1092
00:59:57,395 --> 01:00:00,315
No. No, I don't think so.

1093
01:00:00,398 --> 01:00:01,900
Let Stuckel handle it.

1094
01:00:01,983 --> 01:00:03,902
He'll give them passes to a screening

1095
01:00:03,985 --> 01:00:05,904
where they can sit two rows
behind Michelle Pfeiffer.

1096
01:00:05,987 --> 01:00:07,864
They'll leave you alone.

1097
01:00:07,947 --> 01:00:09,366
- Griffin.
- Yeah?

1098
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:12,827
Um, a guy named Joe Gillis called

1099
01:00:12,911 --> 01:00:15,997
and he said he wants you to meet him
at the Saint James Club

1100
01:00:16,081 --> 01:00:17,999
around 10:00 on the patio.

1101
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:20,085
- Know who this is?
- Joe Gillis? Never heard of him.

1102
01:00:20,168 --> 01:00:22,087
He said you'd know.

1103
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,339
Anybody know who Joe Gillis is?

1104
01:00:24,422 --> 01:00:26,842
He's the character
William Holden played in <i>Sunset Blvd.</i>

1105
01:00:26,925 --> 01:00:28,844
The writer who gets killed
by the movie star.

1106
01:00:28,927 --> 01:00:31,407
- Gloria Swanson.
- That is a fantastic movie.

1107
01:00:31,471 --> 01:00:34,265
<i>All I know is we're doing this my way.</i>

1108
01:00:34,349 --> 01:00:36,851
Oh, that guy.

1109
01:00:36,935 --> 01:00:39,479
Last week he said
he was Charles Foster Kane.

1110
01:00:39,562 --> 01:00:42,232
Week before that it was Rhett Butler.

1111
01:00:42,315 --> 01:00:45,235
<i>Why would they think that
I'd kill my own sister's husband?</i>

1112
01:00:45,318 --> 01:00:47,362
You wanna compare grosses, Bonnie?

1113
01:00:47,445 --> 01:00:49,614
<i>I was in love with him.</i>

1114
01:01:30,655 --> 01:01:33,199
- Griffin? Griffin.
- Malcolm McDowell.

1115
01:01:33,283 --> 01:01:35,326
- Hi. How are you?
- Good to see you.

1116
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,913
Listen, the next time
you want to bad-mouth me,

1117
01:01:38,997 --> 01:01:41,624
have the courage to do it to my face.

1118
01:01:41,708 --> 01:01:43,710
You guys are all the same.

1119
01:01:53,845 --> 01:01:56,598
- You love it there?
- I love it. It's just wonderful.

1120
01:01:56,681 --> 01:01:59,309
You love your career too,
though, don't you? What is it, Tom?

1121
01:01:59,392 --> 01:02:02,604
It was a complete disaster. I mean, look at
what happened in <i>Heaven's Gate</i> with Cimino.

1122
01:02:02,687 --> 01:02:05,315
- It just ended.
- We both are concerned about your ca...

1123
01:02:05,398 --> 01:02:07,038
I knew an actor.
I won't mention his name.

1124
01:02:07,066 --> 01:02:09,778
You know, where I live, I really know
how people think and how they feel.

1125
01:02:09,861 --> 01:02:11,446
- I mean, if you're —
- But it's Montana. My God.

1126
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:15,158
Montana will end you. It ended —
It ended Cimino on <i>Heaven's Gate.</i>

1127
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:17,327
Griffin Mill. Hi.

1128
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,329
- Andy Civella.
- Hi, Andy. How are ya?

1129
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:21,248
I've got Andie MacDowell
sitting over here.

1130
01:02:21,331 --> 01:02:23,583
You know her? She's so hot.
Come over and meet her.

1131
01:02:23,666 --> 01:02:25,293
- Still living in New York?
- Huh?

1132
01:02:25,376 --> 01:02:27,671
Oh, well, I couldn't live here.
I'm allergic to happiness.

1133
01:02:27,754 --> 01:02:30,424
- This is Andie. It's Griffin Mill.
- Hi, Andie. It's good to see you.

1134
01:02:30,507 --> 01:02:32,467
- She's my namesake.
- How are the kids doing?

1135
01:02:32,550 --> 01:02:34,845
- They're great. Thanks.
- She's the smart Andie and I'm the pretty one.

1136
01:02:34,928 --> 01:02:37,305
- Thank you.
- Uh, and you geniuses know each other.

1137
01:02:37,388 --> 01:02:38,890
- Tom Oakley.
- Course we do.

1138
01:02:38,973 --> 01:02:40,823
- Oh, yes. Hi, Tom.
- Hi. How are you?

1139
01:02:41,684 --> 01:02:44,146
It's funny. I just ran into
Malcolm McDowell out in the lobby.

1140
01:02:44,229 --> 01:02:45,647
Oh, really?

1141
01:02:45,730 --> 01:02:48,316
You know, Roddy McDowell is related
to a cousin of my brother-in-law.

1142
01:02:48,399 --> 01:02:51,152
Well, I'm not related
to either one of them.

1143
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:03,206
- If I write it, I direct it.
- Hi.

1144
01:03:03,289 --> 01:03:05,584
The last three pictures you directed
were bombs.

1145
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,169
- Look, one broke even.
- Bombs!

1146
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:09,963
- Thank you so much for the drink, um —
- That was the worst one of the bunch.

1147
01:03:10,046 --> 01:03:11,673
- I really have to go.
- You gotta go, Andie?

1148
01:03:11,756 --> 01:03:13,633
- Come on, honey, let's go.
- We'll walk you to the car.

1149
01:03:13,716 --> 01:03:17,053
- No, it's okay. Don't worry about it.
- Oh, hang on. Griffin.

1150
01:03:17,136 --> 01:03:18,889
- We'd like to buy you a drink.
- I — I'm sorry.

1151
01:03:18,972 --> 01:03:21,266
- Have a drink.
- I can't. I'm meeting someone. Business.

1152
01:03:21,349 --> 01:03:23,268
- Uh-huh.
- We should have told him about <i>Habeas Corpus.</i>

1153
01:03:23,351 --> 01:03:25,270
Of course, of course, of course,
but he's a busy man.

1154
01:03:25,353 --> 01:03:28,273
- Is there anyone waiting for me?
- No one's asked.

1155
01:03:28,356 --> 01:03:32,193
Well, I'm expecting someone.
I'll, um, be out by the pool.

1156
01:03:32,277 --> 01:03:35,154
But he'll get back to us. Right, Griffin?

1157
01:03:35,238 --> 01:03:37,031
- Griffin.
- Andie!

1158
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:13,860
- Ha! Oh, sorry. Sorry, Griffin.
- Oh, Jesus, Andy, it's you.

1159
01:04:13,943 --> 01:04:16,738
- Course, it's me.
- Listen, I can't ask you to join me.

1160
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:19,991
- I told you, I'm meeting somebody.
- Yeah, you're meeting me.

1161
01:04:20,074 --> 01:04:23,036
- We got some big business.
- You? You?

1162
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:25,872
- Why not me?
- Jesus Christ, Andy. You think this is funny?

1163
01:04:25,955 --> 01:04:28,708
- You think this is fucking funny?
- What are you talkin' about?

1164
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:30,919
Wouldn't she make a great Nora?

1165
01:04:31,002 --> 01:04:33,505
God, I'd love to write
another <i>Doll's House</i> for her.

1166
01:04:33,588 --> 01:04:36,424
Oh, did you meet Tom Oakley?

1167
01:04:36,507 --> 01:04:38,009
Yes.

1168
01:04:38,092 --> 01:04:40,762
- You mean, you didn't call me?
- No, I didn't call you.

1169
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:43,431
I'm sorry. I — I'm really sorry.

1170
01:04:44,682 --> 01:04:48,061
Listen, I really am meeting somebody.

1171
01:04:48,144 --> 01:04:50,563
There's no way
I can hear a pitch right now.

1172
01:04:50,647 --> 01:04:53,066
- You'll have to call me tomorrow.
- No, I can't do it tomorrow.

1173
01:04:53,149 --> 01:04:55,652
I got a meeting at
Paramount in the morn...

1174
01:04:55,735 --> 01:04:57,612
I got a meeting at Universal, too,
in the morning.

1175
01:04:57,695 --> 01:04:58,863
Congratulations.

1176
01:04:58,947 --> 01:05:01,783
- If you don't hear it now, you're gonna lose it.
- Well, then I lose it, all right?

1177
01:05:01,866 --> 01:05:03,535
Take 20 seconds.
When your friend gets here, whatever.

1178
01:05:03,618 --> 01:05:05,161
What friend?
What are you talking about? Who?

1179
01:05:05,244 --> 01:05:07,580
Whoever you're gonna meet here.

1180
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:10,875
Twenty-five words or less.

1181
01:05:10,959 --> 01:05:13,795
Absolutely. Tom, uh, you —
No, you sit here, Tom.

1182
01:05:13,878 --> 01:05:15,630
Go.

1183
01:05:15,713 --> 01:05:18,383
- District attorney's at a moral crossroads.
- Tom! Jesus Christ.

1184
01:05:18,466 --> 01:05:20,468
Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh...

1185
01:05:20,551 --> 01:05:23,513
We open outside
the largest penitentiary in California.

1186
01:05:23,596 --> 01:05:25,306
It's night. It's raining.

1187
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:28,643
A limousine comes in through the front
gate past a tight knot of demonstrators

1188
01:05:28,726 --> 01:05:30,603
holding a candlelight vigil.

1189
01:05:30,687 --> 01:05:34,440
The candles under the umbrellas
make them glow like Japanese lanterns.

1190
01:05:34,524 --> 01:05:37,443
That's nice.
I haven't seen that before. That's good.

1191
01:05:37,527 --> 01:05:41,322
A lone demonstrator, a black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

1192
01:05:41,406 --> 01:05:43,700
The lights illuminate her like a spirit.

1193
01:05:43,783 --> 01:05:47,370
Her eyes fix upon those
of the sole passenger.

1194
01:05:49,455 --> 01:05:51,499
The moment is devastating between them.

1195
01:05:51,582 --> 01:05:54,794
He's the DA. She's the mother
of the person that's being executed.

1196
01:05:54,877 --> 01:05:57,380
You're good. See, I told you. He's good.

1197
01:05:57,463 --> 01:05:58,965
- Go on.
- Okay.

1198
01:05:59,048 --> 01:06:01,509
The DA believes in the death penalty.

1199
01:06:01,592 --> 01:06:03,761
And the execution is a hard case.

1200
01:06:03,845 --> 01:06:06,222
Black, 19 and definitely guilty.

1201
01:06:06,305 --> 01:06:08,266
We're in the greatest democracy
in the world,

1202
01:06:08,349 --> 01:06:11,019
and 36% of the people
on death row are black.

1203
01:06:11,102 --> 01:06:13,021
- Poor, disadvantaged black.
- More. More. More.

1204
01:06:13,104 --> 01:06:18,484
He swears that the next person he sees
to die is gonna be smart, rich and white.

1205
01:06:18,568 --> 01:06:21,279
- You. Me. Whoever.
- Oh, what a hook, huh?

1206
01:06:21,362 --> 01:06:24,449
- Beauty hook. Cut to the chase, Tom.
- Okay, okay.

1207
01:06:24,532 --> 01:06:29,037
Cut from the DA to an up-market
suburban neighborhood.

1208
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:30,705
A couple have a fight.

1209
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:34,625
He leaves in a fit, gets in a car.
It's the same rainy night.

1210
01:06:34,709 --> 01:06:37,462
The car spins out on a road,
goes into a ravine.

1211
01:06:37,545 --> 01:06:39,672
The body is swept away.

1212
01:06:39,756 --> 01:06:44,802
Now, when the police examine the car, they
find the brakes have been tampered with.

1213
01:06:44,886 --> 01:06:48,264
It's murder, and the DA decides
to go for the big one.

1214
01:06:48,347 --> 01:06:50,933
He's gonna put the wife
in the gas chamber.

1215
01:06:51,017 --> 01:06:52,811
But the DA falls in love with the wife.

1216
01:06:52,894 --> 01:06:56,231
But of course he falls in love with the wife,
but he puts her in the gas chamber anyway.

1217
01:06:56,314 --> 01:07:00,985
Then he finds that the husband is alive,
that he faked his death.

1218
01:07:02,153 --> 01:07:06,991
The DA breaks into the prison, runs down
death row, but he gets there too late.

1219
01:07:07,617 --> 01:07:10,078
The gas pellets have been dropped.

1220
01:07:10,161 --> 01:07:12,246
She's dead.

1221
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:16,542
I tell you,
there's not a dry eye in the house.

1222
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:18,169
She's dead?

1223
01:07:18,252 --> 01:07:20,546
She's dead. She's dead.

1224
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:23,091
Because that's the reality.

1225
01:07:23,174 --> 01:07:25,009
The innocent die.

1226
01:07:26,385 --> 01:07:28,596
- Who's the DA?
- Ah.

1227
01:07:28,679 --> 01:07:30,515
- No one.
- No one?

1228
01:07:30,598 --> 01:07:33,601
No "stars" on this project.
We're going out on a limb on this one.

1229
01:07:33,684 --> 01:07:36,395
You know, uh, like, unknowns, stage actors

1230
01:07:36,479 --> 01:07:39,232
or maybe somebody English,
like what's-his-name.

1231
01:07:41,317 --> 01:07:43,319
- Why?
- Why? Why?

1232
01:07:43,402 --> 01:07:48,574
Because this story is just too damned important
to risk being overwhelmed by personality.

1233
01:07:48,658 --> 01:07:51,369
You know, that's fine for action pictures,
but this is special.

1234
01:07:51,452 --> 01:07:53,329
We want real people here.

1235
01:07:53,412 --> 01:07:56,290
We don't want people coming
with any preconceived notions.

1236
01:07:56,374 --> 01:07:58,709
We want them to see a district attorney.

1237
01:07:58,793 --> 01:08:01,379
- Bruce Willis.
- No. Not Bruce Willis.

1238
01:08:01,462 --> 01:08:02,964
Not Kevin Costner.

1239
01:08:03,047 --> 01:08:05,883
This is an innocent woman
fighting for her life.

1240
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,844
- Julia Roberts.
- If we can get her.

1241
01:08:07,927 --> 01:08:09,428
Of course we can get her.

1242
01:08:09,512 --> 01:08:11,723
If I'm perfectly honest,
if I think about this,

1243
01:08:11,806 --> 01:08:14,058
this isn't even an American film.

1244
01:08:16,102 --> 01:08:19,480
- It's not?
- No, no. There are no stars.

1245
01:08:19,564 --> 01:08:23,192
No pat happy endings.
No Schwarzenegger, no stickups.

1246
01:08:23,276 --> 01:08:25,278
No — No terrorists.

1247
01:08:25,361 --> 01:08:29,073
This is a tough story, a tragedy
in which an innocent woman dies.

1248
01:08:29,157 --> 01:08:33,202
Why? Because that happens.

1249
01:08:35,163 --> 01:08:37,498
<i>Habeas Corpus.</i>

1250
01:08:37,582 --> 01:08:40,459
That's what we're calling it.
"Produce the corpse."

1251
01:08:40,543 --> 01:08:42,253
What do you say? Yes or no?

1252
01:08:43,379 --> 01:08:45,173
That pitch was more than 25 words.

1253
01:08:45,256 --> 01:08:48,259
Yeah, but it's brilliant.
What's the verdict, Griffin?

1254
01:08:48,342 --> 01:08:50,011
Mr. Mill, for you.

1255
01:08:51,012 --> 01:08:53,931
- Who gave this to you?
- I received it at the front desk.

1256
01:08:54,015 --> 01:08:55,933
What is it?

1257
01:08:58,895 --> 01:09:01,814
It's, um — It's from the person
I was meeting.

1258
01:09:01,898 --> 01:09:03,774
He's not coming.

1259
01:09:03,858 --> 01:09:06,235
Well, do we have a shot? Griffin.

1260
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:08,738
It's an intriguing idea.
Give me a call at the studio tomorrow.

1261
01:09:08,821 --> 01:09:09,822
- Yeah!
- Okay.

1262
01:09:09,906 --> 01:09:12,534
There's a scene in <i>Throne of Blood</i>
that has exactly the texture.

1263
01:09:12,617 --> 01:09:15,203
Tom. Tom. Tom. Just say thank you.

1264
01:09:15,286 --> 01:09:17,122
She has to die.
No fucking Hollywood ending.

1265
01:09:17,205 --> 01:09:19,165
- Tom, "thank you" say.
- God!

1266
01:11:14,155 --> 01:11:17,199
Fuck you!
You fucking dog-shit writer!

1267
01:11:17,283 --> 01:11:21,245
You fucking try to kill me? Fuck!

1268
01:11:41,724 --> 01:11:43,601
Oh, God.

1269
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:46,020
You gave me such a scare.

1270
01:11:46,103 --> 01:11:48,314
What are you doing here?

1271
01:11:48,397 --> 01:11:51,776
You gave me such a fright. Come in.

1272
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:54,737
Come on in.

1273
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,948
What's the matter?

1274
01:11:58,032 --> 01:12:00,368
You look terrible.

1275
01:12:00,451 --> 01:12:01,952
What's up?

1276
01:12:03,996 --> 01:12:06,290
Sit down. I'll get you a drink.

1277
01:12:17,968 --> 01:12:19,887
Something happened?

1278
01:12:20,888 --> 01:12:23,641
- Is it too late? I — I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no.

1279
01:12:23,724 --> 01:12:25,559
It's not too late. No.

1280
01:12:25,643 --> 01:12:27,520
I don't even know what time it is.

1281
01:12:27,603 --> 01:12:29,105
What's wrong?

1282
01:12:34,276 --> 01:12:36,654
What are you painting? Is that me?

1283
01:12:36,737 --> 01:12:38,239
Yeah.

1284
01:12:38,322 --> 01:12:39,824
It's you.

1285
01:12:41,367 --> 01:12:42,868
See?

1286
01:12:42,952 --> 01:12:45,287
Do you have snakes in Iceland?

1287
01:12:45,371 --> 01:12:47,248
Snakes? No, I don't think so, no.

1288
01:12:47,331 --> 01:12:49,083
Are you afraid of snakes?

1289
01:12:49,166 --> 01:12:52,128
I — I don't know.
I've never come close to a real one.

1290
01:12:52,211 --> 01:12:55,005
They scare the shit out of me.

1291
01:13:00,553 --> 01:13:03,055
- Here, have another.
- No, I don't usually drink.

1292
01:13:03,139 --> 01:13:04,515
I...

1293
01:13:07,852 --> 01:13:10,020
Something happened tonight.

1294
01:13:11,063 --> 01:13:12,857
Yes, but, um,

1295
01:13:15,067 --> 01:13:17,403
there's something else I have to tell you.

1296
01:13:20,197 --> 01:13:22,366
This isn't easy for me.

1297
01:13:23,701 --> 01:13:25,035
Yes?

1298
01:13:31,709 --> 01:13:33,961
How about if I just get on with my work,

1299
01:13:34,044 --> 01:13:38,299
and you talk to me
when you feel like it, okay?

1300
01:13:45,723 --> 01:13:48,392
I came very close to dying tonight.

1301
01:13:52,062 --> 01:13:54,231
All I could think about was you.

1302
01:13:55,399 --> 01:13:58,068
I don't even know you.

1303
01:13:58,152 --> 01:14:00,613
But you came into my mind, and...

1304
01:14:03,032 --> 01:14:06,619
I couldn't —
I couldn't think of anything else.

1305
01:14:10,247 --> 01:14:13,209
Remember that first night
we spoke on the phone?

1306
01:14:15,377 --> 01:14:17,379
I was outside these windows,

1307
01:14:18,923 --> 01:14:20,758
watching you, and, um...

1308
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:28,599
It was so exciting and so... new

1309
01:14:28,682 --> 01:14:30,351
and, uh...

1310
01:14:32,353 --> 01:14:33,938
strange.

1311
01:14:37,358 --> 01:14:39,610
I can't get you out of my mind.

1312
01:14:43,113 --> 01:14:45,282
Are you making love to me?

1313
01:14:48,369 --> 01:14:50,371
Yes. I guess I am.

1314
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:54,083
I guess I am.

1315
01:14:57,628 --> 01:14:59,630
I want to make love to you.

1316
01:15:04,134 --> 01:15:06,178
I want to make love to you.

1317
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,348
It's too soon.

1318
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,271
It's too soon, isn't it?

1319
01:15:16,814 --> 01:15:19,817
It's so strange how things happen.

1320
01:15:21,652 --> 01:15:25,364
David was here, then he left.

1321
01:15:27,074 --> 01:15:28,909
You arrived.

1322
01:15:31,495 --> 01:15:34,415
Maybe it's just the timing,
but I feel like

1323
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:37,501
I would go anywhere with you

1324
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:41,088
if you asked.

1325
01:15:45,259 --> 01:15:47,553
We mustn't hurry things.

1326
01:15:47,636 --> 01:15:50,848
You know, we can't hurry things

1327
01:15:50,931 --> 01:15:53,517
any more than we can stop them.

1328
01:15:55,644 --> 01:15:58,022
I think you better go now.

1329
01:15:58,105 --> 01:16:00,357
I think I'm going to cry now.

1330
01:16:05,154 --> 01:16:07,156
Better go, quick.

1331
01:16:13,996 --> 01:16:15,456
I'm sorry.

1332
01:16:15,539 --> 01:16:17,291
No, no, no. Don't be sorry.

1333
01:16:17,374 --> 01:16:20,377
Just go home and get some sleep

1334
01:16:20,461 --> 01:16:23,213
and... call me.

1335
01:16:24,882 --> 01:16:26,383
Tomorrow.

1336
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,928
Invite me on a proper date.

1337
01:16:31,388 --> 01:16:33,057
I'd like that.

1338
01:16:48,364 --> 01:16:50,449
<i>Jan? Jan!</i>

1339
01:16:50,532 --> 01:16:52,576
- Yeah?
<i>- Get me Larry Levy on the phone.</i>

1340
01:16:52,660 --> 01:16:55,245
- I don't think he's on the lot.
<i>- Try his car.</i>

1341
01:16:56,372 --> 01:16:59,124
- Isn't he at Fox?
- He used to be. Not anymore.

1342
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:03,003
Ah. I pitched him something
a few months ago, and he hated it.

1343
01:17:03,087 --> 01:17:04,797
<i>Yeah, Griffin?</i>

1344
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,717
Yeah, yeah. Listen, Larry.
I've got Tom Oakley and Andy Civella here.

1345
01:17:08,801 --> 01:17:11,401
And I wouldn't be bothering you
if I didn't think they had an idea

1346
01:17:11,428 --> 01:17:12,888
<i>that you should hear right away.</i>

1347
01:17:12,971 --> 01:17:15,224
- Hi, guys.
<i>- Hi, Larry.</i>

1348
01:17:15,307 --> 01:17:18,107
Uh, listen, the next voice you're
gonna hear has got an English accent.

1349
01:17:18,185 --> 01:17:20,270
Tom Oakley. I'm Andy Civella.

1350
01:17:20,354 --> 01:17:22,940
Hi, Andy. I know Tom.
How are you, Tom?

1351
01:17:23,023 --> 01:17:25,150
Uh, very well, Larry. And yourself?

1352
01:17:25,234 --> 01:17:27,277
Fine. What's your story?

1353
01:17:28,362 --> 01:17:31,240
We open outside San Quentin.
It's night.

1354
01:17:31,323 --> 01:17:33,659
It's raining.

1355
01:17:33,742 --> 01:17:35,661
<i>A limousine enters through the front gate,</i>

1356
01:17:35,744 --> 01:17:39,164
<i>past a tight knot of demonstrators
holding a candlelight vigil.</i>

1357
01:17:39,248 --> 01:17:41,208
<i>The candles are flickering
underneath the umbrellas,</i>

1358
01:17:41,291 --> 01:17:43,335
making them glow like Japanese lanterns.

1359
01:17:43,419 --> 01:17:47,131
A lone demonstrator, black woman,
steps in front of the limousine.

1360
01:17:47,214 --> 01:17:49,633
<i>Her eyes connect with the lone passenger.</i>

1361
01:17:49,717 --> 01:17:52,136
<i>It's a devastating
moment for both of them.</i>

1362
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:53,721
<i>Incredibly potent.</i>

1363
01:17:56,223 --> 01:17:58,267
No stars. No Schwarzenegger.

1364
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:01,478
No pat Hollywood endings.
No car chases.

1365
01:18:01,562 --> 01:18:05,315
This is an American tragedy
in which an innocent woman dies.

1366
01:18:05,399 --> 01:18:08,569
Because that happens.
That's reality.

1367
01:18:10,028 --> 01:18:11,928
<i>Take me off the speakerphone, Griffin.</i>

1368
01:18:13,741 --> 01:18:15,576
- Yeah?
- I don't know.

1369
01:18:15,659 --> 01:18:19,705
It's a really hot story.
But what is this bullshit — no stars?

1370
01:18:19,788 --> 01:18:23,667
Let me give you a little tip, Larry.
Levison came to power on two movies.

1371
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:26,170
They made $300 million
and had no stars in them.

1372
01:18:26,253 --> 01:18:28,631
He's gonna love this idea.
It'll remind him of his youth.

1373
01:18:28,714 --> 01:18:32,009
You know what his motto used to be?
"No stars, just talent."

1374
01:18:32,092 --> 01:18:35,220
- Has anyone else heard this?
<i>- I don't think so, no.</i>

1375
01:18:36,597 --> 01:18:39,183
We should make a deal now.
Tomorrow may be too late.

1376
01:18:39,266 --> 01:18:41,185
<i>Can we get a hold of Levison?</i>

1377
01:18:41,268 --> 01:18:43,771
Yeah, I'll get Levison.
Uh, when can you be back?

1378
01:18:43,854 --> 01:18:45,606
I'll be there right after my AA meeting.

1379
01:18:45,689 --> 01:18:49,026
Oh, Larry. I didn't realize
you, uh, had a drinking problem.

1380
01:18:49,109 --> 01:18:51,111
Well, I don't really,

1381
01:18:51,195 --> 01:18:53,572
but that's where all the deals
are being made these days.

1382
01:18:53,655 --> 01:18:55,157
See ya.

1383
01:18:56,867 --> 01:18:59,870
Tom, that was a hell of a pitch.

1384
01:19:00,871 --> 01:19:03,582
Good work. I think you sold Larry.

1385
01:19:03,665 --> 01:19:05,918
Great. When are we gonna hear?

1386
01:19:06,001 --> 01:19:08,671
I want you to go home,
I want you to put some champagne on ice,

1387
01:19:08,754 --> 01:19:10,548
and I'll give you an answer by tonight.

1388
01:19:10,631 --> 01:19:12,132
Jan, come in here!

1389
01:19:12,216 --> 01:19:15,135
Griffin, you move in mysterious ways,
but I like it.

1390
01:19:15,219 --> 01:19:16,720
I like it.

1391
01:19:16,804 --> 01:19:19,056
Okay, did Levy understand?
No stars.

1392
01:19:19,139 --> 01:19:21,767
Yes. He was particularly attracted
to that notion.

1393
01:19:21,850 --> 01:19:24,100
- No Hollywood endings?
- No Hollywood ending.

1394
01:19:27,147 --> 01:19:28,816
They looked happy.

1395
01:19:29,566 --> 01:19:32,486
They have a completely fucked-up idea
that has no second act.

1396
01:19:32,569 --> 01:19:35,197
If I hadn't heard it myself,
I never would have believed it.

1397
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:36,865
Larry Levy liked it

1398
01:19:36,949 --> 01:19:38,659
because he's a dick-brain.

1399
01:19:38,742 --> 01:19:40,994
Levy will sell the idea to Levison,

1400
01:19:41,078 --> 01:19:43,705
and then I will let Levison
have the brilliant idea

1401
01:19:43,789 --> 01:19:47,042
of letting Larry
take over the project from me.

1402
01:19:47,125 --> 01:19:48,627
You will?

1403
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:51,380
See, Levison can't wait
to get in bed with Levy.

1404
01:19:51,463 --> 01:19:55,717
This piece-of-shit idea will blow up
in both their faces.

1405
01:19:55,801 --> 01:20:00,222
And then I will step in and save the day.

1406
01:20:02,349 --> 01:20:03,851
<i>- Score!</i>
- Yes!

1407
01:20:04,935 --> 01:20:07,187
<i>Three points!</i>

1408
01:20:07,271 --> 01:20:09,022
<i>Great shot.</i>

1409
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:14,987
She's receiving the last rites.

1410
01:20:15,070 --> 01:20:17,323
The DA discovers that the husband
faked his own death.

1411
01:20:17,406 --> 01:20:18,866
She's innocent.

1412
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:21,202
He races to the penitentiary,
but it's too late.

1413
01:20:21,285 --> 01:20:23,704
The pellets have dropped.
She's dead.

1414
01:20:23,787 --> 01:20:26,415
He helped kill the woman he loved.

1415
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:29,918
- Who are the stars?
- No stars. Just talent.

1416
01:20:30,002 --> 01:20:32,004
No stars?

1417
01:20:32,087 --> 01:20:34,727
And what the fuck kind of ending
do you call that? It's depressing.

1418
01:20:34,798 --> 01:20:36,478
- It'll bring everybody down.
- Depressing?

1419
01:20:36,550 --> 01:20:39,970
Joel, what about <i>Terms of Endearment,
Love Story, Steel Magnolias?</i>

1420
01:20:40,053 --> 01:20:41,555
Joel, <i>E.T.</i> grossed what —
What, Marty?

1421
01:20:41,638 --> 01:20:45,059
$319 million worldwide, pre-cassette,
and there wasn't a dry eye in the house.

1422
01:20:45,142 --> 01:20:47,228
- Depressing? I don't think so.
- Yeah, but...

1423
01:20:47,311 --> 01:20:50,564
Listen, normally I'd agree with you, but this
is an entirely different kind of deal here.

1424
01:20:50,647 --> 01:20:54,484
It is a matter of taking a risk,
rolling the dice.

1425
01:20:54,568 --> 01:20:57,654
But if they come up seven, bingo.

1426
01:20:58,488 --> 01:20:59,990
It's Oscar time.

1427
01:21:01,158 --> 01:21:03,577
- Do they screw?
- Who?

1428
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:06,038
The DA, whoever it is, and the woman.
Do they screw?

1429
01:21:06,121 --> 01:21:08,415
If I'm gonna be looking at jail cells
and gas chambers,

1430
01:21:08,498 --> 01:21:10,334
we're gonna have to have
a little sex in this picture.

1431
01:21:10,417 --> 01:21:12,753
Oh, yeah, sure. Of course.
We'll get it there. No problem.

1432
01:21:12,836 --> 01:21:15,797
Okay. Who's gonna
shepherd this thing?

1433
01:21:18,175 --> 01:21:21,053
Larry, you seem to have a good
feel for this. You wanna run with it?

1434
01:21:21,136 --> 01:21:23,180
Wait a minute, Joel.
This project originated with Griffin.

1435
01:21:23,263 --> 01:21:24,765
- Bonnie.
- No, no.

1436
01:21:24,848 --> 01:21:26,892
I don't wanna dance
in somebody else's wedding.

1437
01:21:26,975 --> 01:21:29,144
If it's Griffin's project,
it's Griffin's project.

1438
01:21:29,227 --> 01:21:32,777
- I just think we should write —
- Bonnie, this will have to be my call.

1439
01:21:34,524 --> 01:21:36,526
It's fine with me.

1440
01:21:36,610 --> 01:21:39,029
My plate is full anyway.

1441
01:21:39,112 --> 01:21:40,781
Larry, it's yours.

1442
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:43,575
Hit a home run.
Win an Oscar for the home team.

1443
01:21:45,827 --> 01:21:47,621
- Griffin, I've got something else for you.
- Yeah?

1444
01:21:47,704 --> 01:21:49,414
- New York, tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1445
01:21:49,498 --> 01:21:51,959
Tom Wolfe's new book will be
in a room at the Sherry-Netherland.

1446
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:54,962
- You go in, read it and make your bid.
- Send Bonnie. She'll know if it's a movie or not.

1447
01:21:55,045 --> 01:21:56,881
- If it is, we know the bid. A million.
- Me?

1448
01:21:56,964 --> 01:21:59,257
A million?
Oh, that's kind of high, isn't it?

1449
01:21:59,883 --> 01:22:01,468
It's Tom Wolfe. Why not you?

1450
01:22:01,551 --> 01:22:03,231
- Yeah? Who?
- I'm a story editor, Griffin.

1451
01:22:03,261 --> 01:22:05,848
- That's a vice president's job.
- You don't want to be a vice president?

1452
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:07,766
Bonnie. Pack your bags.

1453
01:22:07,849 --> 01:22:09,935
- Congratulations.
- Yeah?

1454
01:22:10,018 --> 01:22:12,479
That was the most amazing pitch
I've ever heard.

1455
01:22:12,562 --> 01:22:14,523
Listen, if you don't want
the responsibility, it's fine.

1456
01:22:14,606 --> 01:22:17,234
- No, I'm going. I'm going.
- I really wanna be one of your soldiers.

1457
01:22:17,317 --> 01:22:20,070
Well, I'm glad you're on the team.
Believe me. Thank you for the support.

1458
01:22:20,153 --> 01:22:22,823
Really, and Bonnie's gonna be gone.
I'm here for you.

1459
01:22:23,407 --> 01:22:24,908
Whitney, now!

1460
01:22:26,159 --> 01:22:28,078
Frank, Marty. You want to come in?

1461
01:22:29,162 --> 01:22:31,332
- May I have a word with you, please?
- I have a meeting.

1462
01:22:31,415 --> 01:22:34,015
- Yeah, well, find the time. What is going on?
- What do you mean?

1463
01:22:34,084 --> 01:22:37,004
I mean, handing Larry Levy
your project like that.

1464
01:22:37,087 --> 01:22:40,507
Well, I just thought
Larry had a firm grasp

1465
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:43,010
on... the style of the piece.

1466
01:22:43,093 --> 01:22:44,261
- Oh.
- That's all.

1467
01:22:44,344 --> 01:22:47,222
The only thing Larry Levy has a firm
grasp on is his dick, and you know it.

1468
01:22:47,305 --> 01:22:49,350
Come on, Bonnie. I'm not Oz.
I can't do everything.

1469
01:22:49,433 --> 01:22:52,478
If I think Larry has what it takes to get
a picture made, why shouldn't I use him?

1470
01:22:52,561 --> 01:22:54,521
- That way, everybody wins.
- Why are you bullshitting me?

1471
01:22:54,604 --> 01:22:57,191
- I'm not bullshitting you.
- You never used to bullshit me. Yes, you are.

1472
01:22:57,274 --> 01:22:59,234
- I'm not bullshitting you.
- Griffin, I know you. Something...

1473
01:22:59,317 --> 01:23:00,877
- You've been stringing me along.
- Shh.

1474
01:23:00,902 --> 01:23:02,613
<i>- Habeas Corpus,</i> Griffin.
<i>- Habeas Corpus.</i>

1475
01:23:02,696 --> 01:23:04,197
<i>Habeas Corpus.</i>

1476
01:23:05,407 --> 01:23:07,701
You've been stringing me along
like one of your goddamn writers.

1477
01:23:07,784 --> 01:23:09,954
What is this, getting Levison
to send me to New York?

1478
01:23:10,037 --> 01:23:12,077
What is that about?
Are you trying to get rid of me?

1479
01:23:12,122 --> 01:23:14,166
Trying to get rid of you?
I'm trying to help you.

1480
01:23:14,249 --> 01:23:18,003
If you score in New York, you know,
Levison has to make you a vice president.

1481
01:23:18,086 --> 01:23:21,214
Jesus, Bonnie, what's the matter?
Are you afraid of success?

1482
01:23:21,298 --> 01:23:23,717
- Are you seeing someone else?
- Oh.

1483
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,679
- That's what this is about? Jesus, come on.
- No. It's not just this.

1484
01:23:26,762 --> 01:23:28,931
It's a lot of things, Griffin.
It's the way you've been acting lately.

1485
01:23:29,014 --> 01:23:31,892
- Something is going on,
and I just want to know what it is.
- Jesus Christ, Bonnie.

1486
01:23:31,975 --> 01:23:35,145
You're not even looking at me
when you're talking to me, Griffin.

1487
01:23:35,228 --> 01:23:36,855
I want you to just look at me.

1488
01:23:36,938 --> 01:23:40,484
Please look at me right in the eyes
and just tell me. No bullshit.

1489
01:23:40,567 --> 01:23:42,819
Is there someone else?

1490
01:23:42,903 --> 01:23:44,404
No.

1491
01:23:46,782 --> 01:23:48,450
Have a good trip.

1492

01:24:18,188 --> 01:24:21,441
<i>rubbing elbows and making big talk
in this ballroom.</i>

1500
01:24:21,525 --> 01:24:25,403
<i>All the movers, all the shakers
behind the scenes and on the screens.</i>

1501
01:24:25,487 --> 01:24:28,448
<i>Well, leave it to Cher
to wear fire-engine red</i>

1502
01:24:28,532 --> 01:24:33,286
<i>when the impossible-to-come-by invitations
call for "black and white only, please."</i>

1503
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:35,789
- Hello. Nice to see you.
- Hi, Teri. Nice to see you.

1504
01:24:35,872 --> 01:24:38,834
June Gudmundsdottir.
Teri Garr. Buck Henry.

1505
01:24:38,917 --> 01:24:42,963
<i>And the occasion this evening, just as
big and important as the all-star turnout.</i>

1506
01:24:43,046 --> 01:24:46,967
<i>The studio world famous for the slogan,
"Movies, now more than ever,"</i>

1507
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:51,555
<i>is donating prints of 25 of its classic
black-and-white films to the museum.</i>

1508
01:24:51,638 --> 01:24:55,892
<i>Now they'll be able to say,
"Movies, now more than ever" forever.</i>

1509
01:24:55,976 --> 01:24:57,477
Thank you.

1510
01:24:57,561 --> 01:25:03,316
It's wonderful to see so many familiar
and friendly faces around.

1511
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:08,905
As you know, the LA County Museum
has always been close to our hearts,

1512
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:14,411
and especially the Motion Department —
Uh, Motion Picture Department.

1513
01:25:15,453 --> 01:25:18,456
Uh, we're happy to make possible
this donation.

1514
01:25:19,666 --> 01:25:24,337
Uh, now, I'd-I'd like to introduce
the man whose idea this all was...

1515
01:25:24,421 --> 01:25:26,047
Griffin Mill. Please.

1516
01:25:32,929 --> 01:25:34,639
Thank you, Joel.

1517
01:25:35,724 --> 01:25:39,269
Why don't you grab another drink?

1518
01:25:41,605 --> 01:25:43,982
I'd like to extend my thanks

1519
01:25:44,065 --> 01:25:46,610
to the patrons of
the Los Angeles County Museum.

1520
01:25:47,360 --> 01:25:50,655
You have long fostered
the art of motion pictures

1521
01:25:50,739 --> 01:25:54,618
as a serious and valuable art form
in this community.

1522
01:25:55,785 --> 01:25:58,663
Many people across the country
and around the world

1523
01:25:58,747 --> 01:26:01,082
have for too long thought of movies

1524
01:26:01,166 --> 01:26:04,628
as a popular entertainment
more than serious art.

1525
01:26:05,378 --> 01:26:09,633
And I'm afraid a large majority
of the press supports this attitude.

1526
01:26:09,716 --> 01:26:13,553
We want great films with long shelf lives.

1527
01:26:13,637 --> 01:26:19,267
We want the films of the new John Hustons,
Orson Welles, Frank Capra.

1528
01:26:19,351 --> 01:26:24,564
We and the other major film studios
have a responsibility to the public

1529
01:26:24,648 --> 01:26:28,652
to maintain the art of motion pictures

1530
01:26:28,735 --> 01:26:31,655
as our primary mandate.

1531
01:26:31,738 --> 01:26:35,033
Movies are art

1532
01:26:35,116 --> 01:26:38,453
now more than ever.

1533
01:26:39,287 --> 01:26:40,830
Thank you.

1534
01:26:48,463 --> 01:26:51,550
Griffin, that was a hell of a job.
I couldn't have done it better myself.

1535
01:26:51,633 --> 01:26:53,843
I'll know all of your lines soon.

1536
01:26:56,346 --> 01:26:59,099
Well, are we having fun yet?

1537
01:26:59,182 --> 01:27:01,851
I'm having a great time.
I'm very glad we came.

1538
01:27:05,355 --> 01:27:07,107
Yes, I do!

1539
01:27:07,190 --> 01:27:08,900
I did too.

1540
01:27:14,823 --> 01:27:17,492
Is this a friend of a friend?

1541
01:27:17,575 --> 01:27:19,452
- Sorry.
- Well, how did you meet?

1542
01:27:19,536 --> 01:27:21,788
How did we meet?
Well, at a funeral.

1543
01:27:21,871 --> 01:27:24,165
Yes. Isn't that right? Funeral?

1544
01:27:24,249 --> 01:27:25,917
Absolutely. Excuse us.

1545
01:27:26,001 --> 01:27:28,295
Steve, Steve, whose daughter is he with?

1546
01:27:28,378 --> 01:27:30,797
Seriously, I...

1547
01:27:32,048 --> 01:27:34,468
- No, I think she's Marty's cousin.
- I nearly lost my dress.

1548
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:36,803
No, he said she was somebody's daughter.

1549
01:27:36,886 --> 01:27:39,973
- I wanted to know whose daughter she was.
- No. I don't know.

1550
01:27:40,724 --> 01:27:43,226
You would never have chased me in Iceland.

1551
01:28:03,955 --> 01:28:07,959
- Don't make a scene.
- You're doing it all wrong.

1552
01:28:08,043 --> 01:28:10,295
- Here we go.
- Oops.

1553
01:28:10,378 --> 01:28:12,213
That was a good one.

1554
01:28:13,673 --> 01:28:16,676
Well, that's what I call a real date.

1555
01:28:22,098 --> 01:28:24,142
Should I come in?

1556
01:28:24,225 --> 01:28:26,519
Uh, well.

1557
01:28:26,603 --> 01:28:28,396
- "Mmm, well."
- Not tonight.

1558
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:30,857
- Oh. Not tonight.
- But soon.

1559
01:28:31,733 --> 01:28:34,110
Mmm. Very soon.

1560
01:28:36,988 --> 01:28:39,491
- How 'bout Mexico?
- Mexico?

1561
01:28:39,574 --> 01:28:41,493
Neutral territory. Acapulco.

1562
01:28:41,576 --> 01:28:44,329
- I've never been to Acapulco.
- We'll go.

1563
01:28:44,412 --> 01:28:46,832
- Is that the thing to do?
- That's <i>a</i> thing to do.

1564
01:28:46,915 --> 01:28:49,667
- Let's do it then.
- We'll go this weekend.

1565
01:28:49,751 --> 01:28:51,586
- Really?
- Yeah.

1566
01:28:54,047 --> 01:28:56,466
- Do I need a passport?
- Yes.

1567
01:29:45,557 --> 01:29:48,852
Mr. Mill, I'm Detective DeLongpre,
Pasadena Police.

1568
01:29:48,935 --> 01:29:50,854
Yes, I recognize you.

1569
01:29:50,937 --> 01:29:53,231
Did you have a good time
at the party last night?

1570
01:29:53,314 --> 01:29:57,110
No, I didn't. I'm not supposed to
have a good time when I'm on duty.

1571
01:29:57,193 --> 01:29:59,613
Great. Well, what do you want,
Detective DeLongpre?

1572
01:29:59,696 --> 01:30:01,698
I'd like you to come down to the station.

1573
01:30:01,781 --> 01:30:03,825
- Why?
- To look at some pictures.

1574
01:30:03,908 --> 01:30:06,202
- Pictures?
- Mug shots.

1575
01:30:06,286 --> 01:30:08,455
You know, like in the movies.

1576
01:30:08,538 --> 01:30:11,708
Ah, mug shots.
Yes, well, all right.

1577
01:30:11,791 --> 01:30:13,835
- Will you follow me to Pasadena?
- Pasadena.

1578
01:30:13,918 --> 01:30:15,670
- Pasadena.
- Right.

1579
01:30:15,753 --> 01:30:18,089
Will you fasten your safety belt, please?

1580
01:30:22,469 --> 01:30:23,970
- Come, let's go.
- No!

1581
01:30:24,053 --> 01:30:26,181
- Take your hands off of her!
- Hush.

1582
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:28,433
- I want my baby.
- Where's her baby at?

1583
01:30:28,516 --> 01:30:30,435
- Let me go!
- No! Let go of her!

1584
01:30:30,518 --> 01:30:32,812
- Ah, Mr. Mill.
- Hello. How are you?

1585
01:30:32,896 --> 01:30:35,732
Good to see you. Everybody, this is
Mr. Mill. You remember him. He makes movies.

1586
01:30:35,815 --> 01:30:38,818
- Good to see you again.
- Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

1587
01:30:38,902 --> 01:30:41,488
Where the fuck is he going?
Excuse me, sir. Mr. Mill.

1588
01:30:41,571 --> 01:30:44,282
Mr. Mill. Uh, not in here.
This is my lieutenant's office.

1589
01:30:44,365 --> 01:30:47,702
- You can have a seat in my seat right here.
- I'm sorry.

1590
01:30:47,785 --> 01:30:49,746
All right, now. Uh...

1591
01:30:49,829 --> 01:30:52,457
- Willa, could you —
- Sorry.

1592
01:30:52,540 --> 01:30:54,667
Your desk. Thank you.

1593
01:30:54,751 --> 01:30:56,419
Sorry. Have a seat, Mr. Mill.

1594
01:30:56,503 --> 01:30:58,838
Listen, um, before we start, I just got...

1595
01:30:58,922 --> 01:31:01,842
Paul went to see a movie last night
he came in here raving about.

1596
01:31:01,925 --> 01:31:03,968
Paul, what was the name of that movie?

1597
01:31:04,052 --> 01:31:06,513
They changed the lady into a chicken
at the end. What did you say?

1598
01:31:06,596 --> 01:31:08,848
<i>- Freaks.
- Freaks.</i> Have you ever seen this?

1599
01:31:08,932 --> 01:31:10,600
- Tod Browning. Yes.
- Oh.

1600
01:31:10,683 --> 01:31:14,395
One of us. One of us.
One of us. One of us.

1601
01:31:14,479 --> 01:31:16,856
He came in doing th —
He was raving about it.

1602
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:19,859
He loved it. He loved it.
It was thrilling for me.

1603
01:31:19,943 --> 01:31:24,239
Willa, excuse me. Did you happen to see
where the tampons went that were in here?

1604
01:31:24,322 --> 01:31:26,032
'Cause I can't seem to find 'em.

1605
01:31:26,115 --> 01:31:28,826
- I didn't take them.
- Who took 'em? Did he take 'em?

1606
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:30,787
- I don't know. I didn't take 'em.
- Well, who did?

1607
01:31:30,870 --> 01:31:33,831
- I didn't take 'em.
- You see this? Damn.

1608
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:37,710
Um, so do you have a break in the case?

1609
01:31:37,794 --> 01:31:39,629
What makes you say that?

1610
01:31:39,712 --> 01:31:42,674
Well, why else would you bring me here?

1611
01:31:43,800 --> 01:31:45,969
Why else, indeed?

1612
01:31:46,052 --> 01:31:48,680
Paul? Paul.

1613
01:31:48,763 --> 01:31:51,891
Why have we brought
Mr. Mill in here today?

1614
01:31:51,975 --> 01:31:53,768
To look at some pictures.

1615
01:31:53,851 --> 01:31:56,729
Willa, pictures?

1616
01:31:56,813 --> 01:31:58,523
Listen, could you...

1617
01:31:58,606 --> 01:32:01,359
If you remember,
what were you, uh, wearing that night?

1618
01:32:01,442 --> 01:32:04,654
I was wearing, um,
a double-breasted suit, I believe.

1619
01:32:05,572 --> 01:32:07,782
Just put — Oh. It's all right.

1620
01:32:07,865 --> 01:32:10,368
What's the matter?
Mr. Mill, you're so jumpy. Sit down.

1621
01:32:10,451 --> 01:32:12,579
- I'll get it.
- No, that's what she's here for.

1622
01:32:12,662 --> 01:32:14,789
It's all right. Have a seat.

1623
01:32:14,872 --> 01:32:16,499
- Sorry.
- No problem.

1624
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:18,543
Okay.

1625
01:32:18,626 --> 01:32:20,753
Can you take a look at this gentleman?

1626
01:32:20,837 --> 01:32:22,505
- Where were they?
- Right here.

1627
01:32:22,589 --> 01:32:25,008
She found them. Look. You're right.

1628
01:32:25,091 --> 01:32:28,136
Oh, wait a minute.
No, no. These aren't mine.

1629
01:32:28,219 --> 01:32:30,305
These are slender regular.
These are yours.

1630
01:32:30,388 --> 01:32:32,348
Yeah, I guess you have jumbo.

1631
01:32:32,390 --> 01:32:35,101
Well, I do use jumbo.
These are not mine.

1632
01:32:35,184 --> 01:32:38,104
God. Just trying to help you out.

1633
01:32:38,187 --> 01:32:41,482
Um, look, did — did you see this guy
the night of the murder?

1634
01:32:42,984 --> 01:32:46,654
Um — Sorry. Um, no.

1635
01:32:46,738 --> 01:32:49,282
I — You — I — You're putting me
in a terrible position here.

1636
01:32:49,365 --> 01:32:52,452
I would — I would hate to get
the wrong person arrested.

1637
01:32:52,535 --> 01:32:55,872
Oh, please. This is Pasadena.
We do not arrest the wrong person.

1638
01:32:55,955 --> 01:32:58,959
That's LA. See, LA, they kick your ass
and then they arrest you.

1639
01:32:59,042 --> 01:33:00,877
That's what they do.
We don't do that here.

1640
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:02,879
Remember last year?
What was that guy's name?

1641
01:33:02,962 --> 01:33:04,673
They put him on the tape.
What was that?

1642
01:33:04,756 --> 01:33:06,174
- King.
- That's right, King.

1643
01:33:06,257 --> 01:33:08,217
- BLT.
- And he was the wrong guy.

1644
01:33:11,721 --> 01:33:14,474
- Do you have a witness?
- Now, I can't answer that.

1645
01:33:14,557 --> 01:33:18,811
Well, either you have a witness,
or these are suspects in similar murders.

1646
01:33:18,895 --> 01:33:21,356
Mr. Mill, have you been going
to detective school?

1647
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:24,901
No, actually, we're doing a — a movie
right now called <i>The Lonely Room,</i>

1648
01:33:24,984 --> 01:33:27,529
and Scott Glenn plays a detective
much like yourself.

1649
01:33:27,612 --> 01:33:29,739
Is he a black woman?
Don't give me turkey.

1650
01:33:29,822 --> 01:33:31,741
Oh, Lily Tomlin's in that?
I heard about that.

1651
01:33:31,824 --> 01:33:36,579
No, actually I was — I was drawing the
comparison not based on race or gender.

1652
01:33:36,663 --> 01:33:42,085
Speaking of which,
did you go out with, uh, June, uh...

1653
01:33:42,168 --> 01:33:44,504
What is that woman's name?

1654
01:33:44,587 --> 01:33:46,089
Gudmundsdottir.

1655
01:33:46,172 --> 01:33:50,385
What is it? Who — Spell it for me.

1656
01:33:50,468 --> 01:33:53,137
G-U-D-M-U-N-D-S-D-O-T-T-I-R.

1657
01:33:53,221 --> 01:33:55,807
Oh, well, that really helps.
Could you, uh...

1658
01:33:55,890 --> 01:33:58,018
- Did you go out with June —
- Gudmundsdottir?

1659
01:33:58,101 --> 01:34:00,603
- Yeah. Her. Last night?
- Yes, I did.

1660
01:34:00,687 --> 01:34:02,606
Have you guys known each other
a long time?

1661
01:34:02,689 --> 01:34:05,150
No, I spoke to her for the first time
the night Kahane was killed.

1662
01:34:05,233 --> 01:34:07,068
Wow.

1663
01:34:07,151 --> 01:34:09,432
- So you didn't know her before this, huh?
- No, I didn't.

1664
01:34:09,487 --> 01:34:11,406
We met over the phone.

1665
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:13,369
We got to talking,
and one thing led to another.

1666
01:34:13,449 --> 01:34:15,993
Did you fuck her?

1667
01:34:16,077 --> 01:34:18,580
- What kind of question is that?
- I think it's pretty direct.

1668
01:34:18,663 --> 01:34:20,289
Did you fuck her?

1669
01:34:20,832 --> 01:34:23,251
Well, I wouldn't answer that question
without a lawyer in the room.

1670
01:34:23,334 --> 01:34:26,004
And then I probably wouldn't
even answer that question.

1671
01:34:26,087 --> 01:34:27,714
- Hmm.
- Why don't you ask your friend here?

1672
01:34:27,797 --> 01:34:30,216
He's been following me all over the place.
He'll probably know.

1673
01:34:30,299 --> 01:34:36,389
All right. Paul, did Mr. Mill
fuck June "Hudmuuhunta"?

1674
01:34:36,472 --> 01:34:37,974
I didn't see him.

1675
01:34:38,057 --> 01:34:40,226
Well, see, you got away with it.
He didn't see you.

1676
01:34:40,309 --> 01:34:42,062
- What are you implying?
- I'm not implying anything.

1677
01:34:42,145 --> 01:34:44,230
I asked you a direct question.
Did you fuck her?

1678
01:34:44,313 --> 01:34:46,650
And I told you I wouldn't answer that
question without a lawyer in the room.

1679
01:34:46,733 --> 01:34:49,694
- Then why you getting hot under the collar?
- 'Cause you're being rude, Miss Avery.

1680
01:34:49,777 --> 01:34:51,195
Oh, well, excuse me.

1681
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:55,241
But I think it's kinda soon for her to
be gallivanting in the streets with you.

1682
01:34:55,324 --> 01:34:57,660
I'm there for her as a friend, Miss Avery.

1683
01:34:57,744 --> 01:34:59,996
- Mmm.
- Why don't you call her?

1684
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:03,458
I'm sure she'd be happy to pick over
the horror of what's happened to her

1685
01:35:03,541 --> 01:35:05,543
and tell you how we became friends.

1686
01:35:07,086 --> 01:35:08,838
What is this, fucking Iran?

1687
01:35:08,921 --> 01:35:13,176
Since when does the state tell us how long,
and with whom, we can share our grief?

1688
01:35:14,677 --> 01:35:18,097
Or do you hold June Gudmundsdottir
to a special code of conduct

1689
01:35:18,181 --> 01:35:20,183
reserved for women?

1690
01:35:26,522 --> 01:35:28,858
What the fuck are you laughing at?

1691
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:30,902
It's just — You just...

1692
01:35:30,985 --> 01:35:33,571
- I'd like to talk to my lawyer.
- Oh, right!

1693
01:35:34,614 --> 01:35:37,241
- Can't even say the bitch's name!
- One of us.

1694
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:40,036
One of us. One of us.

1695
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:42,580
<i>One of us.</i>

1696
01:35:50,421 --> 01:35:52,841
It's time for you to get yourself
a real good lawyer.

1697
01:35:52,924 --> 01:35:56,260
I had a drink with the guy, Walter.
That's all.

1698
01:35:56,344 --> 01:36:00,807
If you went to Pasadena with intent to
kill, you could go to the gas chamber.

1699
01:36:02,225 --> 01:36:04,936
I went to Pasadena
with the intent to hire.

1700
01:36:05,686 --> 01:36:08,564
- So you say.
- Griffin, the Schecter brothers are here.

1701
01:36:08,648 --> 01:36:11,984
- Griffin.
- Griffin. Don't make us wait.

1702
01:36:12,068 --> 01:36:14,862
- Who's this man?
- Oh, and the travel agent called.

1703
01:36:14,946 --> 01:36:16,865
- You're confirmed.
- Griffin, he grabbed the phone from me.

1704
01:36:16,948 --> 01:36:20,243
- Travel agent?
- I'm going to Puerto Vallarta.

1705
01:36:20,326 --> 01:36:22,119
You're leaving the country?

1706
01:36:22,203 --> 01:36:24,622
- For the weekend.
- It's a risk.

1707
01:36:24,705 --> 01:36:26,249
Why?

1708
01:36:26,332 --> 01:36:29,544
Because Larry Levy
could have my office in three days.

1709
01:36:29,627 --> 01:36:31,712
That's what Walter thinks.

1710
01:36:31,796 --> 01:36:34,215
You know something I don't know?

1711
01:36:35,383 --> 01:36:38,344
- You're pretty smooth.
- I sleep at night.

1712
01:36:40,429 --> 01:36:42,766
- You really should run the studio.
- Tell a friend.

1713
01:36:42,849 --> 01:36:45,560
Yeah, Walter, it's been real.

1714
01:36:45,643 --> 01:36:48,062
Griffin. We're tired
of shopping everything around.

1715
01:36:48,145 --> 01:36:49,856
We wanna go exclusive to one studio.

1716
01:36:49,939 --> 01:36:52,317
- How much have our last three pictures made?
- A hundred and five million dollars.

1717
01:36:52,400 --> 01:36:54,068
- That's not a lot.
- I know some people do better.

1718
01:36:54,151 --> 01:36:56,112
But we're consistent,
and we're always under budget.

1719
01:36:56,195 --> 01:36:58,865
- He's not listening. Let's go to Columbia.
- We already went to Columbia.

1720
01:36:58,948 --> 01:37:00,491
Oh, yeah. What did they say?

1721
01:37:00,575 --> 01:37:02,243
- Bonnie.
- Hey, Bon.

1722
01:37:02,326 --> 01:37:04,370
Hey. I got the Tom Wolfe book.

1723
01:37:04,453 --> 01:37:06,706
Congratulations.

1724
01:37:06,789 --> 01:37:09,625
Bonnie, make him give us a deal.
We want a home.

1725
01:37:09,709 --> 01:37:11,711
We're tired of shopping everything around.

1726
01:37:11,794 --> 01:37:14,255
Really? I thought that's how
you guys like to do business.

1727
01:37:14,338 --> 01:37:16,090
Well, we changed our minds.

1728
01:37:16,924 --> 01:37:18,426
I'll talk to you later.

1729
01:37:19,802 --> 01:37:22,096
Levison says you're going
out of town tomorrow.

1730
01:37:22,179 --> 01:37:24,765
For the weekend.

1731
01:37:24,849 --> 01:37:28,477
Are you going with someone
named June something?

1732
01:37:29,103 --> 01:37:30,146
Yes.

1733
01:37:31,105 --> 01:37:35,693
You took her to a party, Griffin,
with several hundred of my best friends.

1734
01:37:35,776 --> 01:37:37,695
She's recently widowed.

1735
01:37:37,778 --> 01:37:40,323
You weren't in town, so I took her.

1736
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:44,493
And now you're taking her to Mexico
for the weekend.

1737
01:37:45,995 --> 01:37:48,289
Carl, uh, let's get out of here.
Mom and Dad are fighting.

1738
01:37:48,372 --> 01:37:52,418
Guys, have your lawyer give me a call.

1739
01:37:52,501 --> 01:37:54,629
- You've got a deal.
- Yes!

1740
01:37:54,712 --> 01:37:56,923
Come on, Carl, let's get out of here
before he changes his mind.

1741
01:37:57,006 --> 01:37:58,507
We have witnesses.

1742
01:38:11,395 --> 01:38:13,064
Have a good trip.

1743
01:38:20,363 --> 01:38:25,660
<i>The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading of passengers only.</i>

1744
01:38:25,743 --> 01:38:27,328
<i>No parking.</i>

1745
01:38:27,411 --> 01:38:32,875
<i>Do not leave your car unattended
due to the current security alert.</i>

1746
01:38:32,959 --> 01:38:37,463
<i>All unattended cars
may be towed away immediately.</i>

1747
01:38:37,546 --> 01:38:40,800
<i>- For your safety —</i>
- Uh, did you bring your passport?

1748
01:38:40,883 --> 01:38:42,510
- Yeah.
- You wanna hear something funny?

1749
01:38:42,593 --> 01:38:44,136
I forgot mine.

1750
01:38:44,220 --> 01:38:46,598
Oh, does that mean
we have to go back and get it?

1751
01:38:46,681 --> 01:38:48,600
- So stupid of me. I mean, I —
- We'll miss the plane.

1752
01:38:48,683 --> 01:38:52,019
We'll never be able to make
another plane today. Damn it!

1753
01:38:52,103 --> 01:38:54,897
It's all right.
Anyway, I got a better idea.

1754
01:38:54,981 --> 01:38:57,400
- Do you like the desert?
- I've never been to the desert.

1755
01:38:57,483 --> 01:38:59,043
- You've never been to the desert?
- No.

1756
01:38:59,068 --> 01:39:01,321
I know this great hideaway,
Desert Hot Springs.

1757
01:39:01,404 --> 01:39:04,741
We'll go there. It's a two-hour drive.
I know the people. We'll call ahead.

1758
01:39:04,824 --> 01:39:07,034
Are we hiding?

1759
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:10,329
Yeah, yeah. We're hiding.
We're hiding from everybody.

1760
01:39:12,498 --> 01:39:14,959
You'll like it there.
It'll remind you of Iceland.

1761
01:39:47,491 --> 01:39:49,994
Evening, Mr. M.
You're all checked in.

1762
01:39:50,077 --> 01:39:51,788
Capone Villa. You know where it is.

1763
01:39:51,871 --> 01:39:53,873
- Yep. Thanks, Walter.
- Have a good one.

1764
01:40:21,317 --> 01:40:24,070
Hey, look.
The water looks like it's steaming.

1765
01:40:24,153 --> 01:40:26,572
Comes out of the ground that way.

1766
01:40:48,594 --> 01:40:50,596
There aren't many people around.

1767
01:40:51,514 --> 01:40:53,933
Well, they're fully booked, actually.

1768
01:40:54,016 --> 01:40:55,935
There's 50 rooms, a hundred people.

1769
01:40:56,018 --> 01:40:58,270
Where are they all?

1770
01:40:58,354 --> 01:41:00,272
Hiding.

1771
01:41:00,356 --> 01:41:02,691
Sir?

1772
01:41:02,775 --> 01:41:05,111
A couple of Banning Springs water, please.

1773
01:41:05,194 --> 01:41:07,071
Right away, Mr. M.

1774
01:41:09,698 --> 01:41:12,201
Do places like this really exist?

1775
01:41:13,619 --> 01:41:15,371
Only in the movies.

1776
01:41:45,901 --> 01:41:49,321
Tell me about the movies you make.

1777
01:41:49,405 --> 01:41:51,031
Why?

1778
01:41:51,115 --> 01:41:54,910
Mmm, because I want to know what you do.

1779
01:41:56,829 --> 01:42:02,793
Well, I listen to stories and decide
if they'll make good movies or not.

1780
01:42:02,877 --> 01:42:05,129
I get 125 phone calls a day.

1781
01:42:05,212 --> 01:42:08,841
And if I let that slip to 100,

1782
01:42:08,924 --> 01:42:12,678
I know I'm not doing my job.

1783
01:42:12,761 --> 01:42:14,763
Oh.

1784
01:42:14,847 --> 01:42:17,183
And everyone that calls,
they wanna know one thing.

1785
01:42:17,266 --> 01:42:21,395
They want me to say yes to them
and make their movie.

1786
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:25,233
If I say yes to them and make their movie,
they think that come New Year's

1787
01:42:25,316 --> 01:42:29,612
that it's gonna be them and Jack Nicholson
on the slopes of Aspen.

1788
01:42:30,863 --> 01:42:32,865
That's what they think.

1789
01:42:35,492 --> 01:42:38,454
Problem is, I can only say yes...

1790
01:42:38,537 --> 01:42:41,290
my studio can only say yes
12 times a year.

1791
01:42:41,373 --> 01:42:46,212
And, collectively, we hear
about 50,000 stories a year.

1792
01:42:47,213 --> 01:42:49,632
So it's hard.

1793
01:42:49,715 --> 01:42:53,177
And I guess sometimes I'm not nice

1794
01:42:53,260 --> 01:42:57,139
and... I make enemies.

1795
01:42:59,141 --> 01:43:01,310
And that's what I was to David.

1796
01:43:02,603 --> 01:43:04,772
An enemy.

1797
01:43:04,855 --> 01:43:07,775
Was his story one of the 12?

1798
01:43:07,858 --> 01:43:10,152
No, it wasn't.

1799
01:43:10,236 --> 01:43:11,737
Why?

1800
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:15,824
It lacks certain elements that we need
to market a film successfully.

1801
01:43:16,951 --> 01:43:18,452
What elements?

1802
01:43:21,163 --> 01:43:25,376
Suspense, laughter, violence,

1803
01:43:27,878 --> 01:43:30,214
hope, heart,

1804
01:43:32,675 --> 01:43:34,260
nudity, sex,

1805
01:43:36,679 --> 01:43:38,347
happy endings.

1806
01:43:39,765 --> 01:43:41,684
Mainly happy endings.

1807
01:43:45,771 --> 01:43:47,690
What about reality?

1808
01:43:49,316 --> 01:43:51,318
You're not from Iceland, are you?

1809
01:43:53,195 --> 01:43:55,114
Did I say that?

1810
01:43:56,115 --> 01:43:57,533
Hmm.

1811
01:43:58,409 --> 01:44:01,870
Why don't you put me in the hot springs
and see if I melt?

1812
01:44:41,076 --> 01:44:42,745
I love you.

1813
01:44:50,794 --> 01:44:52,504
I love you.

1814
01:44:52,588 --> 01:44:54,590
I know.

1815
01:44:54,673 --> 01:44:56,175
I know.

1816
01:45:03,807 --> 01:45:05,309
I love you.

1817
01:45:06,643 --> 01:45:09,855
- There's something you have to know.
- Do I have to?

1818
01:45:09,938 --> 01:45:11,774
- I know I love you.
- Something I have to tell you.

1819
01:45:11,857 --> 01:45:13,776
That's all I need.

1820
01:45:13,859 --> 01:45:15,778
Nothing can change that.

1821
01:45:15,861 --> 01:45:17,196
- June.
- Hmm?

1822
01:45:17,279 --> 01:45:21,075
- David's death.
- Shh. It's in the past.

1823
01:45:21,158 --> 01:45:24,453
Don't. Don't. It's another life.

1824
01:45:24,536 --> 01:45:27,539
I have to tell you something.
Something you have to know.

1825
01:45:27,623 --> 01:45:29,875
Shh. Don't, don't, don't say any more.

1826
01:45:29,958 --> 01:45:33,003
- Don't.
- I was — I was responsible.

1827
01:45:33,087 --> 01:45:35,422
- I love you. Don't.
- It was my fault.

1828
01:45:35,506 --> 01:45:37,549
Shh. Don't say...

1829
01:45:37,633 --> 01:45:40,719
Don't, don't, don't. I love you.

1830
01:45:56,193 --> 01:45:58,487
Mmm.

1831
01:45:58,570 --> 01:46:00,072
Ah.

1832
01:47:00,007 --> 01:47:03,469
Mr. M? Mr. M?
Sorry to disturb you.

1833
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,721
There's a telephone call,
and it sounds important.

1834
01:47:05,804 --> 01:47:07,806
- Who is it?
- A Mr. Dick Mellen.

1835
01:47:07,890 --> 01:47:10,058
He says he's your lawyer.

1836
01:47:31,747 --> 01:47:33,540
Dick, how'd you find me?

1837
01:47:33,624 --> 01:47:36,793
<i>Come on, Griff. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?</i>

1838
01:47:36,877 --> 01:47:38,754
Yeah. What's going on?

1839
01:47:38,837 --> 01:47:41,548
<i>- Levison's out.</i>
- Out?

1840
01:47:41,632 --> 01:47:44,718
They gave him six hours
to clean out his office.

1841
01:47:44,801 --> 01:47:46,720
<i>- Who's taking over?</i>
- There's nothing been decided.

1842
01:47:46,803 --> 01:47:50,553
All we know for sure is Reggie Goldman
went home with the clap or something.

1843
01:47:51,225 --> 01:47:53,101
Listen, am I in a position to...

1844
01:47:53,185 --> 01:47:55,187
Listen, I don't want to talk
about studio politics.

1845
01:47:55,270 --> 01:47:58,170
Why the hell didn't you tell me
about this Kahane business?

1846
01:47:58,732 --> 01:48:00,442
Kahane?

1847
01:48:00,526 --> 01:48:03,904
- Well, I tried to, Dick, but —
- You didn't try hard enough.

1848
01:48:03,987 --> 01:48:07,187
You better be at the Pasadena
Police Station in about four hours.

1849
01:48:08,367 --> 01:48:10,911
Pasadena? What for?

1850
01:48:10,994 --> 01:48:13,997
For a fuckin' lineup, that's what for.

1851
01:48:14,081 --> 01:48:15,707
They got a witness, evidently.

1852
01:48:15,791 --> 01:48:18,377
Now, look, I found you a guy.
His name is Gar Girard.

1853
01:48:18,460 --> 01:48:20,963
<i>He's a top-flight criminal lawyer.
He's tough. He's hard-nosed.</i>

1854
01:48:21,046 --> 01:48:24,633
<i>Don't you talk to anybody else.
Just get there.</i>

1855
01:48:24,716 --> 01:48:28,428
- I'll be there.
<i>- Griffin, this is a tough one.</i>

1856
01:48:28,512 --> 01:48:31,348
<i>Good luck.</i>

1857
01:48:31,431 --> 01:48:32,933
Thanks.

1858
01:48:41,608 --> 01:48:46,238
Mr. Mill, the studio's very upset about
the publicity this might, uh, generate.

1859
01:48:46,321 --> 01:48:49,283
But I'll handle the press, the police,
the judge and the witness for you.

1860
01:48:49,366 --> 01:48:51,619
Mr. Mill. Thank you for
coming down without a fight.

1861
01:48:51,702 --> 01:48:54,705
You know, it's really in your best
interest. What, did you sleep in that suit?

1862
01:48:54,788 --> 01:48:56,540
Mr. Mill, get away from that woman.
She's the enemy.

1863
01:48:56,623 --> 01:48:57,874
- Follow me.
- Hi, Susan.

1864
01:48:57,958 --> 01:49:01,086
- Had a lovely time at the Mint the other night.
- I can't believe you remember it.

1865
01:49:01,169 --> 01:49:03,547
Mr. Mill, Gar Girard.
I'm here to represent you.

1866
01:49:03,630 --> 01:49:06,341
Dick Mellen called me in on this.
Here's the situation.

1867
01:49:06,425 --> 01:49:08,761
They've got a witness,
and they want you to do a lineup.

1868
01:49:08,844 --> 01:49:11,263
Now, if you say no, they'll arrest you,
I'm certain of that.

1869
01:49:11,346 --> 01:49:14,391
And even if you get identified,
I'll get you off on bail.

1870
01:49:14,474 --> 01:49:18,270
Now, this witness lives across
the street from the parking lot.

1871
01:49:18,353 --> 01:49:21,190
Even if she makes an identification,
a positive ID, right now,

1872
01:49:21,273 --> 01:49:24,359
even if that happens,
it was very late at night.

1873
01:49:24,443 --> 01:49:28,531
By the time I'm finished with her, the world will
have a whole new legal standard for blindness.

1874
01:49:28,614 --> 01:49:32,409
- Keep the faith and we'll do what we can.
- This is just like they do it on television.

1875
01:49:32,492 --> 01:49:34,494
Excuse me, Susan. Good luck.

1876
01:49:34,578 --> 01:49:37,790
You don't have to worry about a thing.
You can see them, but they can't see you.

1877
01:49:37,873 --> 01:49:40,292
- Fine. Fine.
- All you have to do is just tell the truth.

1878
01:49:40,375 --> 01:49:44,046
Oh, I will. Because I saw him clearly.
There's no problem.

1879
01:49:45,839 --> 01:49:47,341
All right, Allen. Fire it up.

1880
01:49:48,175 --> 01:49:50,594
Number one, step forward.

1881
01:49:50,677 --> 01:49:52,888
Make a quarter turn to the right.

1882
01:49:54,056 --> 01:49:55,975
- Face forward.
- Are those prescription glasses, Mrs. Bunny?

1883
01:49:56,058 --> 01:49:57,601
- You can't ask her that.
- Fine.

1884
01:49:57,684 --> 01:49:59,524
- It's very hard, you know.
- Oh, yeah. I know.

1885
01:49:59,603 --> 01:50:01,723
- Number two, take one step forward.
- Take your time.

1886
01:50:01,772 --> 01:50:03,732
I mean, I wouldn't want
to pick the wrong one.

1887
01:50:03,815 --> 01:50:05,567
No. God forbid.

1888
01:50:05,651 --> 01:50:07,819
- Now you just take your time.
- Oh, I know.

1889
01:50:07,903 --> 01:50:10,155
Anybody look, uh, vaguely familiar?

1890
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:13,533
- Take a quarter turn to the left.
- Well, you know, uh...

1891
01:50:13,617 --> 01:50:15,177
- Face forward.
- Take your time.

1892
01:50:15,243 --> 01:50:17,371
Step back into position.
Number three, take one step forward.

1893
01:50:17,454 --> 01:50:19,539
- This is not easy.
- I know it isn't.

1894
01:50:19,623 --> 01:50:21,959
- It never is, Mrs. Bunny.
- I mean, I am trying.

1895
01:50:22,042 --> 01:50:23,961
- Yes. Just take your time.
- Take your time.

1896
01:50:24,044 --> 01:50:26,505
And I did see him clearly.

1897
01:50:26,588 --> 01:50:29,758
Make a quarter turn to the left.

1898
01:50:29,841 --> 01:50:31,385
No, no, no.

1899
01:50:31,468 --> 01:50:33,387
- Step back.
- No, no.

1900
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:36,181
- I don't — Well —
- AVERY: Look hard. Look really...

1901
01:50:36,264 --> 01:50:39,184
- Take a good look.
- I did, I did. I — I am.

1902
01:50:39,267 --> 01:50:42,312
Um, could I — Could I see, um...

1903
01:50:42,396 --> 01:50:45,441
- Well, number three again?
- Call number three for her, will you?

1904
01:50:45,524 --> 01:50:47,443
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
See number five again.

1905
01:50:47,526 --> 01:50:49,862
- Could I —
- GIRARD: Could she call her own numbers?

1906
01:50:49,945 --> 01:50:52,323
- Excuse me.
- She said she wants to see again. Thank you.

1907
01:50:52,406 --> 01:50:54,126
- Number five, take one step forward.
- Um...

1908
01:50:54,199 --> 01:50:56,785
- Which number? Number five again.
- Um — Excuse, uh, um...

1909
01:50:56,868 --> 01:50:59,538
Susan, I think she
can call who she's interested in.

1910
01:50:59,621 --> 01:51:01,861
- You're absolutely right.
- No, the — No, the other one.

1911
01:51:01,915 --> 01:51:03,417
That one.

1912
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:05,001
- Which one?
- By the number.

1913
01:51:05,085 --> 01:51:06,629
- Oh, um —
- Number six, take one step forward.

1914
01:51:06,712 --> 01:51:08,213
- It's not number six.
- Not number six.

1915
01:51:08,296 --> 01:51:09,757
- That much I know.
- Bring back number five.

1916
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:11,383
- Three.
- Three.

1917
01:51:11,466 --> 01:51:12,968
What do you mean, number three?

1918
01:51:13,051 --> 01:51:15,429
I think she can request
whoever she wants to see.

1919
01:51:15,512 --> 01:51:18,057
- You wanna see what number?
- She wants to see number three.

1920
01:51:18,140 --> 01:51:21,309
That's him.
I'd swear on my mother's grave.

1921
01:51:21,393 --> 01:51:24,354
Number three.
I think we're concluded here, Ms. Avery.

1922
01:51:24,438 --> 01:51:26,690
- Number three.
- Number three, on her mother's grave.

1923
01:51:26,773 --> 01:51:28,233
- Yes.
- Number three?

1924
01:51:28,316 --> 01:51:30,652
Number three.
I think we heard what she said.

1925
01:51:30,736 --> 01:51:33,322
- Yeah, I would — I would say so.
- Okay, Doug, take 'em out.

1926
01:51:33,405 --> 01:51:35,532
Number three, thank you. Okay, fine.

1927
01:51:35,615 --> 01:51:37,951
- Just relax. You're in a chair.
- I'm in a chair. Ooh.

1928
01:51:38,034 --> 01:51:39,578
- Ma'am, may I be personal?
- Yes.

1929
01:51:39,661 --> 01:51:42,289
Where the fuck is your mother buried?

1930
01:51:42,372 --> 01:51:45,622
- Everybody, let's get out of here.
- Let's get out of this sauna.

1931
01:51:49,588 --> 01:51:53,550
I don't know who got to that witness, but she
sure wrapped up my case, picking that cop.

1932
01:51:53,633 --> 01:51:56,595
You're a lucky man, Mr. Mill.
Goddamn it. No ramp again.

1933
01:51:56,678 --> 01:51:58,722
Witnesses can't be relied on.

1934
01:51:58,805 --> 01:52:01,684
Remember <i>Witness for the Prosecution?</i>
Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power?

1935
01:52:01,767 --> 01:52:04,519
That's it. You're free as a bird.
No witness, no crime.

1936
01:52:04,603 --> 01:52:07,106
Yeah, that Avery woman thinks
you just got away with murder.

1937
01:52:07,189 --> 01:52:09,274
Everybody does, Mr. Mill.

1938
01:52:57,072 --> 01:52:59,658
Our Father, who art in heaven,

1939
01:52:59,741 --> 01:53:01,952
hallowed be thy name.

1940
01:53:02,035 --> 01:53:06,248
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

1941
01:53:07,249 --> 01:53:10,627
Give us this day our daily bread

1942
01:53:10,710 --> 01:53:13,213
and forgive us our trespasses.

1943
01:53:21,304 --> 01:53:23,557
For thine is the kingdom

1944
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:26,726
and the power and the glory forever.

1945
01:53:26,810 --> 01:53:28,311
Amen.

1946
01:54:52,312 --> 01:54:54,773
You've made a wonderful movie.

1947
01:54:54,856 --> 01:54:56,316
It's perfect.

1948
01:54:56,399 --> 01:54:58,652
It's Oscar time, Larry.

1949
01:55:04,282 --> 01:55:05,367
What?

1950
01:55:05,450 --> 01:55:07,118
We're too late. Come on.

1951
01:55:11,081 --> 01:55:12,582
<i>Go on.</i>

1952
01:55:16,002 --> 01:55:18,338
- Hey, hey!
- Get back!

1953
01:55:36,398 --> 01:55:38,316
Oh.

1954
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,403
- What took you so long?
- Traffic was a bitch.

1955
01:55:52,122 --> 01:55:55,291
It's outstanding.
The audience is gonna love it.

1956
01:55:55,375 --> 01:55:57,419
You — You sold it out!
I can't believe it.

1957
01:55:57,502 --> 01:56:00,589
How could you let him sell you out?
What about truth? What about the reality?

1958
01:56:00,672 --> 01:56:03,591
What about the way the old ending
tested in Canoga Park?

1959
01:56:03,675 --> 01:56:05,218
Everybody hated it.

1960
01:56:05,301 --> 01:56:07,220
We reshot it.
Now everybody loves it.

1961
01:56:07,303 --> 01:56:08,805
That's reality.

1962
01:56:08,888 --> 01:56:11,433
But you had an ending which was true.
You didn't even give it a chance.

1963
01:56:11,516 --> 01:56:13,268
Larry, who is this person?

1964
01:56:13,351 --> 01:56:15,103
Doesn't she know anything
about working with grown-ups?

1965
01:56:15,186 --> 01:56:17,230
Bonnie, goddamn it, goddamn it.

1966
01:56:17,313 --> 01:56:20,358
This is a hit.
This is what we're here for.

1967
01:56:20,442 --> 01:56:22,652
Yeah, well, it didn't
have to end this way.

1968
01:56:22,736 --> 01:56:25,947
- I want you out of here.
- Good thinkin', Larry.

1969
01:56:26,031 --> 01:56:28,366
I'm going over your head, Larry.

1970
01:56:28,450 --> 01:56:30,910
Bonnie, you're fired.

1971
01:56:32,370 --> 01:56:33,872
Fuck you.

1972
01:56:33,955 --> 01:56:37,000
Oh, it takes more to make it
in this business than a dirty mouth.

1973
01:56:37,083 --> 01:56:39,085
Gentlemen, the campaign.

1974
01:56:45,300 --> 01:56:46,801
Shit.

1975
01:57:00,982 --> 01:57:02,442
<i>Two points!</i>

1976
01:57:07,530 --> 01:57:09,992
Celia, it's very important.
I need to talk to him right now.

1977
01:57:10,075 --> 01:57:12,035
- No, Bonnie, he's very busy.
- Celia, please.

1978
01:57:12,118 --> 01:57:14,496
- Bonnie. Bonnie.
- Please, it's me, Bonnie. We're friends.

1979
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:16,498
Bonnie, you don't understand.

1980
01:57:16,581 --> 01:57:18,708
I am not just me. I'm also the job.

1981
01:57:18,792 --> 01:57:21,586
Please. Please. Please.

1982
01:57:21,669 --> 01:57:26,132
Oh, honey. All right, all right.
I'll try, okay?

1983
01:57:29,010 --> 01:57:31,096
<i>Three points.</i>

1984
01:57:31,179 --> 01:57:34,933
<i>- Take that!</i>
- Oh, Walter, stop that nonsense.

1985
01:57:35,016 --> 01:57:37,936
Griffin, it's Bonnie.

1986
01:57:38,019 --> 01:57:39,521
She's here.

1987
01:57:42,524 --> 01:57:44,442
<i>Great shot.</i>

1988
01:57:44,526 --> 01:57:47,737
- Did Levy fire her?
- Yes, sir. I guess he did.

1989
01:57:49,697 --> 01:57:52,117
Well, I can't see her now.

1990
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:53,993
I promised I'd be home early.

1991
01:57:55,870 --> 01:57:57,622
Tell her I'll get back to her.

1992
01:57:57,705 --> 01:58:00,208
Walter, get your foot
off the fucking couch.

1993
01:58:00,291 --> 01:58:02,168
- Tell her yourself.
- Yes.

1994
01:58:02,252 --> 01:58:05,380
- Okay, well, could you hold, please?
- Griffin. I have to talk to you.

1995
01:58:05,463 --> 01:58:07,466
Griffin, it's Larry Levy's office.
He says it's very important.

1996
01:58:07,549 --> 01:58:10,677
- Griffin, please! Can we talk about it?
- Bonnie, you'll land on your feet.

1997
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:13,096
- I know it. You're a survivor.
- Griffin, it's Larry Levy's office.

1998
01:58:13,179 --> 01:58:16,182
He says it's very important.
Oh, put it in the front seat.

1999
01:58:16,891 --> 01:58:19,341
Give it a minute
and transfer it to the car phone.

2000
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:35,201
- Yeah?
<i>- Griffin, I have Larry Levy on the line.</i>

2001
01:58:35,285 --> 01:58:37,370
Larry, how'd the screening go?
How's my new ending?

2002
01:58:37,453 --> 01:58:40,456
<i>Fantastic! Fantastic!
Worked like gangbusters.</i>

2003
01:58:40,540 --> 01:58:42,709
<i>- That's why you get the big bucks, Griff.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2004
01:58:42,792 --> 01:58:45,837
Stop kissing my ass, Larry.
What do you want? Can't this wait?

2005
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:47,547
<i>I don't think it should. This is hot.</i>

2006
01:58:47,630 --> 01:58:50,270
<i>I got a writer in here who's got a pitch
I think you ought to hear.</i>

2007
01:58:50,341 --> 01:58:52,469
<i>I think it's something we should go for.
It's a great idea.</i>

2008
01:58:52,552 --> 01:58:54,596
- Yeah, who's the writer?
<i>- I'll put him on the speaker.</i>

2009
01:58:54,679 --> 01:58:56,347
<i>Hold on a minute.</i>

2010
01:58:56,431 --> 01:58:58,141
<i>Hiya, Griff. Remember me?</i>

2011
01:58:58,224 --> 01:59:01,561
<i>I'm the asshole who used to be
in the postcard business.</i>

2012
01:59:01,644 --> 01:59:03,354
- You?
<i>- Yeah, that's right.</i>

2013
01:59:03,438 --> 01:59:06,149
<i>The king of suspense himself.
You remember me.</i>

2014
01:59:06,232 --> 01:59:08,193
I haven't heard from you for a while.

2015
01:59:08,276 --> 01:59:11,363
<i>Well, I've been busy. I've been
writing a script. I got inspired.</i>

2016
01:59:11,446 --> 01:59:14,699
<i>Okay, okay. Tell him. Give him the pitch.
You'll love this, Griffin. It's great!</i>

2017
01:59:14,782 --> 01:59:17,744
<i>All right, it's a Hollywood story, Griff.
A real thriller.</i>

2018
01:59:17,827 --> 01:59:21,206
<i>It's about a shit-bag producer,
studio exec,</i>

2019
01:59:21,289 --> 01:59:24,918
<i>who murders a writer
he thinks is harassing him.</i>

2020
01:59:25,001 --> 01:59:28,046
<i>Problem is, he kills the wrong writer.</i>

2021
01:59:28,129 --> 01:59:31,382
<i>Now he's got to deal with blackmail
as well as the cops.</i>

2022
01:59:31,466 --> 01:59:33,509
<i>But here's the switch.</i>

2023
01:59:33,593 --> 01:59:35,803
<i>The son of bitch, he gets away with it.</i>

2024
01:59:35,887 --> 01:59:38,098
Larry, get off the speaker.
I want to talk to him privately.

2025
01:59:38,181 --> 01:59:41,226
<i>Sure thing.
This is a winner, Griffin. It's a winner.</i>

2026
01:59:41,309 --> 01:59:43,061
- He gets away with it?
<i>- Absolutely.</i>

2027
01:59:43,144 --> 01:59:45,063
<i>It's a Hollywood ending, Griff.</i>

2028
01:59:45,146 --> 01:59:49,025
<i>He marries the dead writer's girl,
and they live happily ever after.</i>

2029
01:59:49,108 --> 01:59:50,902
Can you guarantee that ending?

2030
01:59:50,985 --> 01:59:53,238
<i>If the price is right, you got it.</i>

2031
01:59:53,321 --> 01:59:55,282
If you can guarantee me that ending,
you got a deal.

2032
01:59:55,365 --> 01:59:57,033
<i>I guarantee it, Griff.</i>

2033
01:59:57,116 --> 02:00:00,411
- What do you call this thing anyway?
- The Player.

2034
02:00:00,495 --> 02:00:01,996
<i>The Player.</i>

2035
02:00:05,124 --> 02:00:06,626
I like that.

2036
02:00:09,837 --> 02:00:12,090
What took you so long?

2037
02:00:12,173 --> 02:00:14,092
Traffic was a bitch.
