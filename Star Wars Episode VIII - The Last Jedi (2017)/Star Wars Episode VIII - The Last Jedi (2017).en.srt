1
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,418
We're not clear yet.

2
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,045
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

3
00:02:10,128 --> 00:02:11,923
Forget the munitions, there's no time.

4
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,925
Just get everyone on the transports.

5
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,344
Oh, no.

6
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,739
We've caught them in the
middle of their evacuation.

7
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,779
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

8
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,073
This is where we snuff out the Resistance

9
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,574
once and for all.

10
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,786
Tell Captain Canady
to prime his dreadnought.

11
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,997
Incinerate their base,
destroy their transports...

12
00:02:45,164 --> 00:02:47,458
and obliterate their fleet.

13
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,891
General, Resistance ship approaching.

14
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,852
Guns and shields in attack mode.

15
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,272
A single light fighter.

16
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,242
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

17
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,494
We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

18
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,627
Just for the record, Commander Dameron...

19
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,331
I'm with the droid on this one.

20
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,249
Thank you for your support, General.

21
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:30,543
Happy beeps.

22
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,670
Attention.

23
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:34,672
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet...

24
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:37,800
I have an urgent
communiquÃ© for General Hugs.

25
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,343
Patch him through.

26
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,138
This is General Hux of the First Order.

27
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,640
The Republic is no more.

28
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,144
Your fleet are Rebel scum
and war criminals.

29
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,772
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms...

30
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:53,357
there will be no surrender.

31
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,569
Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.

32
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,778
This is Hux.

33
00:03:57,945 --> 00:03:59,697
You and your friends are doomed.

34
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,909
We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.

35
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,870
Okay. I'll hold.

36
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,580
Hello?

37
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,458
Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

38
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,002
Can he hear me?

39
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,337
- Hugs?
- He can.

40
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,297
With an "H." Skinny guy.

41
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,673
Kinda pasty.

42
00:04:18,257 --> 00:04:21,302
I can hear you.
Can you hear me?

43
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,388
Look, I can't hold forever.
If you reach him...

44
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:26,265
tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...

45
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,726
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

46
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,520
...about his mother.

47
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,480
Open fire!

48
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,106
BB-8, punch it!

49
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,583
He's going for the dreadnought.

50
00:04:47,119 --> 00:04:48,204
He's insane.

51
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,333
Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.

52
00:05:06,722 --> 00:05:08,600
All right, taking out the cannons now.

53
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,893
Tallie, start your approach.

54
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,977
Copy that.

55
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,314
Captain Canady, why aren't you
blasting that puny ship?

56
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,398
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

57
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,234
We need to scramble our fighters...

58
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,029
five bloody minutes ago.

59
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,448
He'll never penetrate our armor.

60
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,481
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

61
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,493
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

62
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,122
One cannon left.

63
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:32,589
And here comes the parade.

64
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:39,437
Yeah! Yeah, I see him!

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,554
No, no, no. Damn it!

66
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,014
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

67
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,432
We gotta take out that last cannon...

68
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,683
or our bombers are toast.

69
00:05:50,766 --> 00:05:52,018
Work your magic, buddy.

70
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:09,076
Are the auto-cannons primed?

71
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,328
Primed and ready, sir.

72
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,611
What are we waiting for?

73
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,164
Fire on the base!

74
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:18,753
Punch it!

75
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,221
The last transport is in the air.

76
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,654
The evacuation is complete.

77
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:31,349
You did it, Poe.

78
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,934
Now get your squad back here

79
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,810
so we can get out of this place.

80
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:35,937
No, General...

81
00:06:36,103 --> 00:06:37,730
We can do this.
We have the chance...

82
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:39,113
to take out a dreadnought.

83
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,529
These things are fleet killers.

84
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,613
We can't let it get away.

85
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,948
Disengage now...

86
00:06:47,114 --> 00:06:49,784
Commander.
That is an order...

87
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,751
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

88
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:02,046
Well, I will certainly try, General.

89
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,256
Nervous?

90
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,510
Let's go, BB-8.

91
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:08,678
It's now or never!

92
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,495
Yes!

93
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,165
All clear! Bring the bombs.

94
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,333
Captain...

95
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,669
Resistance bombers approaching.

96
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,171
Of course they are.

97
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,685
Bombers, keep that tight formation.

98
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,896
Fighters, protect the bombers.

99
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,314
It's not every day we get
a shot at a dreadnought,

100
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:02,607
so let's make this count.

101
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,775
Copy that, Blue Leader.

102
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,860
You get us there, we'll give it to them.

103
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,985
- Copy. We're on it.
- Fighters incoming.

104
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,490
Gunners, look alive.

105
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,785
Snubfighters at two-ten!

106
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,037
- They're coming in!
- Form up!

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,413
They're everywhere!

108
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,791
- Here they come.
- Incoming fighters. Form up.

109
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,292
Vector in at attack speed.

110
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,169
- Pull up!
- Flank right.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,964
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
We're going down!

112
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,550
Recharge the auto-cannons.

113
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,677
Target their cruiser.

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,476
I see it. Tallie,
they've targeted the fleet...

115
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,229
and begun the priming sequence.

116
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,522
Copy that.

117
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:43,688
We're almost there.

118
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,192
Bombardiers...

119
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,069
begin your drop sequence.

120
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,118
I've got a visual on the target.

121
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,037
We're approaching the sweet spot.

122
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,291
Bombs are armed.

123
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,649
Auto-cannons aimed.

124
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,276
Forty seconds to full charge.

125
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,778
Destroy that last bomber!

126
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,703
Paige, come in.
We're over the target.

127
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,996
Why aren't your bay doors open?

128
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,529
You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!

129
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,050
- Nix!
- Paige!

130
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,094
Drop the payload now!

131
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,438
Look out!

132
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,441
No!

133
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:11,546
Bombs away!

134
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:39,991
Direct hit!

135
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,117
Dreadnought down!

136
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,153
General, Supreme Leader Snoke...

137
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,322
is making contact from his ship.

138
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,074
Excellent.

139
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,703
I'll take it in my chambers.

140
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,831
General Hux.

141
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,918
Good. Supreme Leader.

142
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,089
My disappointment...

143
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:41,636
in your performance cannot be overstated.

144
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,930
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

145
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:48,309
We have them tied on the end of a string.

146
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,488
Rey!

147
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,506
Well done, pal.

148
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,263
"Finn naked leaking bag"?
What? Did you fry a chip?

149
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:34,397
Finn! Finn, buddy.

150
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:36,649
It's so good to see you.

151
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,859
What? Let's...

152
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:41,153
We need to get you dressed.
Come on.

153
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,572
You must have a thousand questions.

154
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,906
Where's Rey?

155
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,513
Master Skywalker?

156
00:15:12,495 --> 00:15:14,413
Master Skywalker?

157
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,750
I'm from the Resistance.

158
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,711
Your sister Leia sent me.
We need your help.

159
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,180
Hello?

160
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,963
Go away.

161
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:12,445
Chewie, what are you doing here?

162
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,516
He said you're coming back with us.

163
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,600
How did you find me?

164
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:17,766
Long story.
We'll tell you on the Falcon.

165
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,896
Falcon?

166
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,941
Wait.

167
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,155
Where's Han?

168
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,247
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

169
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,709
The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.

170
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,003
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

171
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:54,388
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur...

172
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,017
in such a place of power?

173
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,854
A cur's weakness, properly manipulated...

174
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,733
can be a sharp tool.

175
00:17:07,902 --> 00:17:09,529
How's your wound?

176
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,906
It's nothing.

177
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:18,996
The mighty Kylo Ren.

178
00:17:19,914 --> 00:17:21,582
When I found you...

179
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,337
I saw what all masters live to see.

180
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:30,383
Raw, untamed power.

181
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:35,972
And beyond that, something truly special.

182
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,225
The potential of your bloodline.

183
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:44,605
A new Vader.

184
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,864
Now I fear...

185
00:17:54,532 --> 00:17:57,118
I was mistaken.

186
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:01,914
I've given everything I have to you.

187
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:04,375
To the dark side.

188
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,378
Take that ridiculous thing off.

189
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:20,349
Yes, there it is.

190
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:25,229
You have too much of
your father's heart in you,

191
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:26,397
young Solo.

192
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,065
I killed Han Solo.

193
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,277
When the moment came, I didn't hesitate.

194
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,778
And look at you,

195
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:36,365
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

196
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,035
You were unbalanced...

197
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:42,914
bested by a girl who had
never held a lightsaber!

198
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,081
You failed!

199
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,794
Skywalker lives.

200
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:54,759
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

201
00:18:54,926 --> 00:18:56,802
And as long as it does...

202
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,389
hope lives in the galaxy.

203
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:05,686
I thought you would be the one
to snuff it out.

204
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:09,941
Alas, you're no Vader.

205
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,653
You're just a child...

206
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,782
in a mask.

207
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:51,649
Prepare my ship.

208
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,272
There's no light left in Kylo Ren.

209
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:01,909
He's only getting stronger.

210
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:03,328
The First Order will control

211
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:05,913
all the major systems within weeks.

212
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,957
We need your help.

213
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,751
We need the Jedi Order back.

214
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:15,464
We need Luke Skywalker.

215
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,013
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

216
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,265
Did you hear a word I just said?

217
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,349
You think what?

218
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,894
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword

219
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,062
and face down the whole First Order?

220
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,941
What did you think
was going to happen here?

221
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:35,151
You think that I came...

222
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,403
to the most unfindable place in the galaxy

223
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,280
for no reason at all?

224
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,199
Go away.

225
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:43,618
I'm not leaving without you!

226
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:52,645
Careful!

227
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,266
You're wasting your time.

228
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,762
Who are you?

229
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,726
I know this place.

230
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,151
Built a thousand generations ago...

231
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:07,113
to keep these.

232
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,533
The original Jedi texts.

233
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:17,582
Just like me, they're the last
of the Jedi religion.

234
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,503
You've seen this place.

235
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,589
You've seen this island.

236
00:24:25,173 --> 00:24:27,133
Only in dreams.

237
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:30,136
Who are you?

238
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,721
The Resistance sent me.

239
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:32,889
They sent you?

240
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,308
What's special about you?

241
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,103
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

242
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:42,064
- No one's from nowhere.
- Jakku.

243
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,067
All right, that is pretty much nowhere.

244
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:47,862
Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?

245
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,179
The Resistance sent me.

246
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,449
We need your help.

247
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:52,575
The First Order's become unstoppable.

248
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:55,244
Why are you here?

249
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:11,302
Something inside me has always been there.

250
00:25:13,763 --> 00:25:15,598
But now it's awake.

251
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,976
And I'm afraid.

252
00:25:20,269 --> 00:25:21,569
I don't know what it is...

253
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,856
or what to do with it.

254
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,316
And I need help.

255
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:28,277
You need a teacher.

256
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,446
I can't teach you.

257
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,281
Why not?

258
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,785
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

259
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,539
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

260
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:42,208
I came to this island to die.

261
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,921
It's time for the Jedi to end.

262
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:48,923
Why?

263
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,677
Leia sent me here with hope.

264
00:25:52,844 --> 00:25:55,680
If she was wrong,
she deserves to know why.

265
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:57,974
We all do.

266
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:28,796
You're demoted.

267
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,881
What? Wait!

268
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,132
We took down a dreadnought.

269
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:32,216
At what cost?

270
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,177
You start an attack,
you follow it through.

271
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,804
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

272
00:26:35,887 --> 00:26:39,056
There are things that you cannot solve...

273
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:42,143
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

274
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,187
I need you to learn that.

275
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:47,064
There were heroes on that mission.

276
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,691
Dead heroes.

277
00:26:49,442 --> 00:26:50,860
No leaders.

278
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,326
We're really nowhere.

279
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,161
How's Rey gonna find us now?

280
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,123
A cloaked binary beacon.

281
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,750
To light her way home.

282
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,504
All right, so until she
gets back, what's the plan?

283
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,380
We need to find a new base.

284
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:12,841
One with enough power to get

285
00:27:12,924 --> 00:27:14,800
a distress signal to our allies...

286
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,344
scattered in the Outer Rim.

287
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,056
Proximity alert!

288
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,349
They found us.

289
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,767
That's impossible.

290
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,406
That's Snoke's ship.

291
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:38,824
You gotta be kidding me.

292
00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,410
Can we jump to lightspeed?

293
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,203
We have enough fuel resources
for just one jump.

294
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:43,580
Well, then, do it.
We gotta get out of here.

295
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:44,872
Wait.

296
00:27:46,082 --> 00:27:48,584
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

297
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:50,920
That's impossible.

298
00:27:51,546 --> 00:27:52,547
Yes.

299
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,925
And they've done it.

300
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:57,886
So if we jump through lightspeed...

301
00:27:57,969 --> 00:28:00,138
they'll just find us again
and we'll be out of fuel.

302
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:01,222
They've got us.

303
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,974
Not yet, they don't.

304
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,560
Permission to jump in an
X-wing and blow something up?

305
00:28:05,643 --> 00:28:06,978
Permission granted.

306
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,604
Admiral, swing us around!

307
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:10,898
Full astern. Rotate shields!

308
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:14,110
To your stations!
Move, move, move!

309
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:28,958
Follow my lead.

310
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,424
Green Squadron to launch position.

311
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,676
Clear all launch traffic.

312
00:28:42,305 --> 00:28:44,405
Don't wait for me! Jump in
and fire her up!

313
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,976
Technicians, lock down supplies

314
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,394
for launch conditions.

315
00:29:19,342 --> 00:29:20,343
Move! Move!

316
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,986
Poe, are you all right?

317
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:41,531
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

318
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,907
We need to what?

319
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,450
Full engines ahead.

320
00:29:44,617 --> 00:29:46,744
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers

321
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:48,371
and the fighters will fall back.

322
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,122
All craft, full engines!

323
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,542
Concentrate rear shields.

324
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,936
Ren, the Resistance
have pulled out of range.

325
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,729
We can't cover you at this distance.

326
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:56,230
Return to the fleet.

327
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,319
What is the point of all this...

328
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,864
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

329
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:07,033
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

330
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:09,077
They can't lose us, but they
can keep at a range...

331
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,161
where our cannons

332
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:11,955
are ineffective against their shields.

333
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,624
Well, keep up the barrage.

334
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,293
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

335
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,544
Very good, sir.

336
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:22,131
They won't last long
burning fuel like this.

337
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,634
It's just a matter of time.

338
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,953
Move! Out of the way,
everybody! Give room!

339
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,289
Life signs are weak, but she's fighting.

340
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:09,924
Artoo?

341
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,260
Artoo!

342
00:34:14,762 --> 00:34:15,763
Yes.

343
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:17,806
Yeah, I know.

344
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,591
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

345
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:25,063
Old friend.

346
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:28,775
I wish I could make you understand.

347
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,821
But I'm not coming back.

348
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:35,867
Nothing can make me change my mind.

349
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:42,956
Years ago, you served
my father in the Clone Wars.

350
00:34:43,123 --> 00:34:44,125
Now he begs you to help him

351
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,794
in his struggle against the Empire.

352
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:46,878
I regret that I am unable to present

353
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,004
my father's request to you in person...

354
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,338
That was a cheap move.

355
00:34:49,547 --> 00:34:51,257
...but my ship
has fallen under attack...

356
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:52,467
and I'm afraid my mission to bring you

357
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,842
to Alderaan has failed.

358
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,887
This is our most desperate hour.

359
00:34:56,053 --> 00:34:57,513
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

360
00:34:58,681 --> 00:34:59,891
You're my only hope.

361
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:13,946
Tomorrow at dawn.

362
00:35:14,697 --> 00:35:15,990
Three lessons.

363
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,784
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi...

364
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,204
and why they need to end.

365
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,590
General Organa...

366
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,842
Leia...

367
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,678
is unconscious but recovering.

368
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,140
That's the only good news I have.

369
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:43,351
Admiral Ackbar...

370
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:46,062
all our leadership, they're gone.

371
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:49,154
Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge.

372
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:50,566
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

373
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:51,651
If she were here,

374
00:35:51,776 --> 00:35:54,820
she'd say save your sorrow
for after the fight.

375
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,114
To that end...

376
00:35:58,241 --> 00:35:59,659
the chain of command is clear

377
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,577
as to who should take her place.

378
00:36:03,037 --> 00:36:04,664
Vice Admiral Holdo...

379
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,874
of the cruiser Ninka.

380
00:36:07,959 --> 00:36:09,502
Thank you, Commander.

381
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:16,926
Four hundred of us...

382
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,594
on three ships.

383
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,723
We're the very last of the Resistance.

384
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:26,978
But we're not alone.

385
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,313
In every corner of the galaxy...

386
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,233
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol...

387
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,318
and they put their hope in it.

388
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:37,864
We are the spark that will light the fire

389
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:39,782
that will restore the Republic.

390
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,952
That spark...

391
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,746
this Resistance, must survive.

392
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,000
That is our mission.

393
00:36:50,501 --> 00:36:51,711
Now, to your stations.

394
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,507
And may the Force be with us.

395
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,347
That's Admiral Holdo?

396
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,392
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

397
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:11,272
Not what I expected.

398
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,649
Vice Admiral?

399
00:37:13,816 --> 00:37:14,817
Commander Dameron.

400
00:37:14,942 --> 00:37:16,152
With our current fuel consumption...

401
00:37:16,235 --> 00:37:17,862
there's a very limited amount of time...

402
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:19,739
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

403
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,158
Very kind of you to make me aware.

404
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,660
Let's get me those fuel projections.

405
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:24,828
And we need to shake 'em

406
00:37:24,911 --> 00:37:26,037
before we can find a new base, so...

407
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,496
what's our plan?

408
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,457
Our plan, captain?

409
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,001
Not commander, right?

410
00:37:32,251 --> 00:37:34,421
Wasn't it Leia's last
official act to demote you...

411
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:35,904
for your dreadnought plan...

412
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:38,841
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

413
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:43,453
"Captain." "Commander."

414
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,098
You can call me whatever you like.

415
00:37:45,181 --> 00:37:46,881
I just wanna know what's going on.

416
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:48,643
Of course you do.

417
00:37:49,143 --> 00:37:50,144
I understand.

418
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:51,813
I've dealt with plenty

419
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,606
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

420
00:37:54,148 --> 00:37:55,149
You're impulsive.

421
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,110
Dangerous.

422
00:37:59,529 --> 00:38:01,379
And the last thing we need right now.

423
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,950
So stick to your post...

424
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,077
and follow my orders.

425
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:21,008
Turbolink banks seven and eight

426
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:23,177
are offline due to maintenance.

427
00:38:56,794 --> 00:38:58,004
What are you doing here?

428
00:38:58,171 --> 00:38:59,505
Hey. Hi.

429
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,550
I was...
You know, I was just...

430
00:39:02,717 --> 00:39:03,926
You're Finn!

431
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:06,095
The Finn!

432
00:39:06,596 --> 00:39:08,306
- The Finn?
- Sorry.

433
00:39:08,723 --> 00:39:10,266
I work behind pipes all day.

434
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,685
Doing talking with Resistance heroes

435
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:14,187
is not my forte.

436
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:16,606
Doing...

437
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:17,899
doing talking.

438
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,526
I'm Rose.

439
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:22,028
Breathe.

440
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,238
- Okay.
- Yeah.

441
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,407
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero, but...

442
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,140
it was nice talking to you, Rose.

443
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:32,872
May the Force be with you.

444
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:34,874
Wow.

445
00:39:34,999 --> 00:39:36,125
You, too.

446
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,544
Okay.

447
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,546
But you are a hero.

448
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:42,257
You left the First Order,

449
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:44,240
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

450
00:39:44,383 --> 00:39:45,927
When we heard about it,
my sister Paige said...

451
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,512
"Rose, that's a real hero."

452
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:49,389
"Know right from wrong...

453
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,433
"and don't run away
when it gets hard," she said.

454
00:39:51,516 --> 00:39:52,517
You know...

455
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,310
just this morning, I've had to stun...

456
00:39:54,393 --> 00:39:55,645
three people trying to jump ship...

457
00:39:55,728 --> 00:39:56,729
in this escape pod.

458
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:57,813
What?

459
00:39:57,897 --> 00:39:59,047
They were running away.

460
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:00,316
That's disgraceful.

461
00:40:01,317 --> 00:40:02,443
I know.

462
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:06,447
Anyway...

463
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,366
Gotta get back to what I was doing, so...

464
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:09,742
What were you doing?

465
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:13,496
- Doing some checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

466
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,581
No, it's routine checks.

467
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:15,998
By boarding one...

468
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,126
with a packed bag.

469
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:20,878
Okay.

470
00:40:21,128 --> 00:40:22,129
Listen, I'm...

471
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:37,728
I can't move. I can't move.

472
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,772
- I know.
- What happened?

473
00:40:39,981 --> 00:40:41,941
I'm taking you to the brig and
turning you in for desertion.

474
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,067
I was not deserting.

475
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:45,517
- I told you that...
- My sister just died...

476
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:47,238
protecting the fleet.

477
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,282
And you were running away.

478
00:40:50,366 --> 00:40:51,492
I'm sorry.

479
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:52,869
But this fleet is doomed...

480
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:54,120
and if my friend comes back to it,

481
00:40:54,203 --> 00:40:55,204
she's doomed, too.

482
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:56,664
I've gotta get this...

483
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,085
I gotta get this beacon
far away from here.

484
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:01,768
Then she'll find me and be safe.

485
00:41:02,378 --> 00:41:04,255
You're a selfish traitor.

486
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:06,591
Look, we can't outrun
the First Order fleet.

487
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:07,974
We can jump to lightspeed!

488
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:09,803
Well, they can track us
through lightspeed.

489
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:11,096
They can track us through lightspeed?

490
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:12,680
Yeah. They'd just show up
thirty seconds later

491
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:13,932
and we'd have blown a ton of fuel...

492
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:16,265
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

493
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:18,561
They can track us through lightspeed.

494
00:41:18,644 --> 00:41:19,854
Yes. And they could...

495
00:41:20,354 --> 00:41:21,454
I can't feel my teeth.

496
00:41:21,939 --> 00:41:23,316
What did you shoot me with?

497
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,483
Active tracking.

498
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,693
What now?

499
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:27,487
Hyperspace tracking is new tech...

500
00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:28,988
but the principle must be the same

501
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,073
as any active tracker.

502
00:41:30,156 --> 00:41:31,157
So they're only tracking us...

503
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,241
Only tracking us...

504
00:41:32,325 --> 00:41:33,743
- ...from the lead ship.
- ...from the lead ship.

505
00:41:33,826 --> 00:41:34,828
But we can't get to the tracker.

506
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:35,912
It's an A-class process,

507
00:41:35,995 --> 00:41:37,122
they'll control it from the main bridge.

508
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:38,540
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

509
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:40,917
...has a dedicated
power breaker.

510
00:41:41,459 --> 00:41:42,460
But...

511
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,003
Wait, but who knows where
the breaker room is

512
00:41:44,086 --> 00:41:45,296
on a Star Destroyer?

513
00:41:47,381 --> 00:41:49,217
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

514
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:50,927
If I can get us there...

515
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,346
I can shut their tracker down.

516
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:55,932
Just give it to me one more time, simpler.

517
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:57,517
So, the First Order's only tracking us

518
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,250
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

519
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:00,562
So we blow that one up?

520
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:01,938
I like where your head's at, but no.

521
00:42:02,021 --> 00:42:03,731
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

522
00:42:03,814 --> 00:42:04,815
But if we can...

523
00:42:04,899 --> 00:42:05,900
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer...

524
00:42:05,983 --> 00:42:07,026
and disable the tracker

525
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:08,570
without them realizing, then we can...

526
00:42:08,653 --> 00:42:10,738
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

527
00:42:10,821 --> 00:42:12,198
About six minutes.

528
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,449
Sneak on board.

529
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:17,036
Disable the tracker.

530
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:20,665
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

531
00:42:29,048 --> 00:42:30,049
How'd you two meet?

532
00:42:33,177 --> 00:42:34,178
Just luck.

533
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:36,806
Yeah?

534
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:38,307
Good luck?

535
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:39,934
Not sure yet.

536
00:42:40,434 --> 00:42:41,811
Poe, we gotta do this.

537
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:44,063
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

538
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,484
If I must be the sole voice of reason...

539
00:42:48,734 --> 00:42:50,884
Admiral Holdo will never
agree to this plan.

540
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:54,240
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

541
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:56,065
It's a "need-to-know" plan...

542
00:42:56,158 --> 00:42:57,159
and she doesn't.

543
00:42:57,285 --> 00:42:59,037
- That wasn't exactly my...
- All right...

544
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,663
you guys shut down that tracker.

545
00:43:00,746 --> 00:43:02,207
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

546
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,291
The question is...

547
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,585
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

548
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:06,753
We steal clearance codes.

549
00:43:06,836 --> 00:43:09,436
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

550
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:13,373
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

551
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:15,136
Nobody can.

552
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:20,516
Could I do it?

553
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:21,883
Of course I could do it.

554
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:23,019
But I can't do it.

555
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:24,979
I'm a little tied down right now.

556
00:43:26,105 --> 00:43:27,106
Maz?

557
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:28,232
What is happening?

558
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:30,985
Union dispute. You do not
want to hear about it.

559
00:43:31,861 --> 00:43:33,613
But, lucky for you...

560
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:35,489
there's exactly one guy I trust

561
00:43:35,656 --> 00:43:37,533
who can crack that kind of security!

562
00:43:40,077 --> 00:43:41,662
He's a master codebreaker,

563
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:42,872
an ace pilot,

564
00:43:43,247 --> 00:43:44,832
a poet with a blaster.

565
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:48,544
Oh, my.

566
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:49,879
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow

567
00:43:49,962 --> 00:43:50,963
can do everything.

568
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:53,549
Oh, yes, he can.

569
00:43:54,926 --> 00:43:58,888
You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel...

570
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:01,641
rolling at a high stakes table...

571
00:44:01,891 --> 00:44:02,892
in the casino...

572
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:04,060
on Canto Bight.

573
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:05,811
Canto Bight?
No, no. That's...

574
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:07,230
Maz...

575
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:09,232
is there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

576
00:44:09,315 --> 00:44:10,399
Sorry, kiddo.

577
00:44:10,608 --> 00:44:11,943
This is rarefied cracking.

578
00:44:12,527 --> 00:44:13,987
You wanna get on that Destroyer,

579
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:15,530
I only know one option.

580
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:18,574
Find the Master Codebreaker.

581
00:45:46,954 --> 00:45:49,248
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

582
00:45:55,505 --> 00:45:57,905
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

583
00:46:02,762 --> 00:46:04,013
Can you see my surroundings?

584
00:46:04,096 --> 00:46:05,682
You're gonna pay for what you did!

585
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:06,974
I can't see yours.

586
00:46:08,643 --> 00:46:09,810
Just you.

587
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:13,481
So, no.

588
00:46:15,107 --> 00:46:17,443
This is something else.

589
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:24,617
Luke.

590
00:46:24,825 --> 00:46:26,577
What's that about?

591
00:46:41,175 --> 00:46:43,553
I was cleaning my blaster.
It went off.

592
00:46:46,597 --> 00:46:47,765
Let's get started.

593
00:46:51,936 --> 00:46:53,396
Who were those things?

594
00:46:54,188 --> 00:46:55,523
Caretakers.

595
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:56,816
Island natives.

596
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:58,151
They've kept up the Jedi structures

597
00:46:58,234 --> 00:46:59,360
since they were built.

598
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:01,654
I don't think they like me.

599
00:47:01,821 --> 00:47:03,489
Can't imagine why.

600
00:47:39,442 --> 00:47:40,776
Master Skywalker...

601
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:42,529
we need you to bring the Jedi back...

602
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:43,780
because Kylo Ren is strong

603
00:47:43,863 --> 00:47:45,463
with the dark side of the Force.

604
00:47:45,573 --> 00:47:48,118
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

605
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:50,536
What do you know about the Force?

606
00:47:51,037 --> 00:47:52,330
It's a power that Jedi have

607
00:47:52,413 --> 00:47:54,213
that lets them control people and...

608
00:47:54,624 --> 00:47:56,125
make things float.

609
00:47:56,292 --> 00:47:57,293
Impressive.

610
00:47:57,376 --> 00:47:59,295
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

611
00:47:59,754 --> 00:48:00,755
Lesson one...

612
00:48:01,005 --> 00:48:03,007
sit here, legs crossed.

613
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:12,892
The Force is not a power you have.

614
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,394
It's not about lifting rocks.

615
00:48:15,770 --> 00:48:17,620
It's the energy between all things...

616
00:48:17,772 --> 00:48:19,815
a tension, a balance...

617
00:48:20,024 --> 00:48:22,276
that binds the universe together.

618
00:48:22,443 --> 00:48:23,444
Okay.

619
00:48:24,612 --> 00:48:25,738
But what is it?

620
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,449
Close your eyes.

621
00:48:30,368 --> 00:48:31,744
Breathe.

622
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:33,788
Now...

623
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:36,040
reach out.

624
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,881
I feel something.

625
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:45,049
- You feel it?
- Yes, I feel it.

626
00:48:45,132 --> 00:48:46,134
- That's the Force.
- Really?

627
00:48:46,217 --> 00:48:47,761
Wow, it must be really strong with you.

628
00:48:47,844 --> 00:48:48,944
I've never felt any...

629
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,221
Ow!

630
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:54,199
You meant reach out like...

631
00:48:56,727 --> 00:48:57,728
I'll try again.

632
00:49:00,231 --> 00:49:01,232
Breathe.

633
00:49:03,568 --> 00:49:05,361
Just breathe.

634
00:49:08,614 --> 00:49:10,783
Reach out with your feelings.

635
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:17,331
What do you see?

636
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:22,712
The island.

637
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:25,423
Life.

638
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:28,009
Death and decay...

639
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:31,012
that feeds new life.

640
00:49:32,805 --> 00:49:33,806
Warmth.

641
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:36,100
Cold.

642
00:49:38,269 --> 00:49:39,562
Peace.

643
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,398
Violence.

644
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:44,984
And between it all?

645
00:49:45,776 --> 00:49:46,777
Balance.

646
00:49:47,528 --> 00:49:48,779
An energy.

647
00:49:51,949 --> 00:49:53,409
A Force.

648
00:49:55,036 --> 00:49:56,662
And inside you?

649
00:49:57,788 --> 00:49:59,415
Inside me...

650
00:50:00,583 --> 00:50:02,627
that same Force.

651
00:50:04,128 --> 00:50:06,923
And this is the lesson.

652
00:50:07,089 --> 00:50:10,218
That Force does not belong to the Jedi.

653
00:50:11,469 --> 00:50:14,263
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

654
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:16,516
Can you feel that?

655
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:19,977
There's something else...

656
00:50:22,021 --> 00:50:23,397
beneath the island.

657
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:25,483
A place.

658
00:50:26,734 --> 00:50:27,860
A dark place.

659
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,113
Balance.

660
00:50:31,906 --> 00:50:33,741
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

661
00:50:34,075 --> 00:50:35,159
It's cold.

662
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,041
It's calling me.

663
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:44,377
Resist it, Rey.

664
00:50:45,628 --> 00:50:46,629
Rey?

665
00:50:49,507 --> 00:50:50,508
Rey!

666
00:50:59,183 --> 00:51:00,935
You went straight to the dark.

667
00:51:02,144 --> 00:51:03,688
That place was trying
to show me something.

668
00:51:03,771 --> 00:51:05,898
It offered something you needed.

669
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:08,818
And you didn't even try to stop yourself.

670
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:11,529
But I didn't see you.

671
00:51:13,531 --> 00:51:15,199
Nothing from you.

672
00:51:18,661 --> 00:51:20,913
You've closed yourself off from the Force.

673
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,877
Of course you have.

674
00:51:27,253 --> 00:51:30,256
I've seen this raw strength
only once before...

675
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,592
in Ben Solo.

676
00:51:32,758 --> 00:51:34,427
It didn't scare me enough then.

677
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:37,221
It does now.

678
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:50,610
What was that?

679
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:51,986
Nothing, admiral.

680
00:51:52,153 --> 00:51:53,529
Passing debris.

681
00:52:00,912 --> 00:52:02,997
The fleet's only got
18 hours of fuel left.

682
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,415
We gotta hurry.

683
00:52:05,875 --> 00:52:07,668
Still can't reach the Resistance?

684
00:52:08,461 --> 00:52:09,462
Keep at it.

685
00:52:09,629 --> 00:52:11,381
If you get through, check their status.

686
00:52:11,464 --> 00:52:12,757
And ask about Finn.

687
00:52:48,042 --> 00:52:50,002
Why is the Force connecting us?

688
00:52:50,419 --> 00:52:51,420
You and I.

689
00:52:51,546 --> 00:52:52,880
Murderous snake.

690
00:52:53,589 --> 00:52:54,590
You're too late.

691
00:52:54,674 --> 00:52:56,717
You lost.
I found Skywalker.

692
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,510
Did he tell you what happened?

693
00:53:00,346 --> 00:53:01,765
The night I destroyed his temple,

694
00:53:01,848 --> 00:53:02,849
did he tell you why?

695
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:05,518
I know everything
I need to know about you.

696
00:53:05,685 --> 00:53:07,019
You do?

697
00:53:09,772 --> 00:53:11,691
You do.

698
00:53:12,984 --> 00:53:14,902
You have that look in your eyes.

699
00:53:15,152 --> 00:53:16,863
From the forest.

700
00:53:19,532 --> 00:53:20,950
When you called me a monster.

701
00:53:21,033 --> 00:53:23,035
You are a monster.

702
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:29,667
Yes, I am.

703
00:53:54,066 --> 00:53:55,067
Okay.

704
00:53:55,151 --> 00:53:56,402
We get in, we find this codebreaker,

705
00:53:56,485 --> 00:53:57,486
we get out.

706
00:53:57,570 --> 00:53:59,780
You know this town?
Canto Bight?

707
00:53:59,947 --> 00:54:01,115
From stories.

708
00:54:01,282 --> 00:54:02,325
It's a terrible place

709
00:54:02,408 --> 00:54:04,744
filled with the worst people
in the galaxy.

710
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:05,912
Great.

711
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,726
I told those two, I said...

712
00:54:28,893 --> 00:54:30,019
"This is a public beach.

713
00:54:30,102 --> 00:54:31,646
"You can't park
that shuttle here."

714
00:54:31,729 --> 00:54:34,273
But they just lit off toward the casino.

715
00:54:41,531 --> 00:54:42,991
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

716
00:54:43,074 --> 00:54:44,659
All bets on the table
right now, right now!

717
00:54:44,742 --> 00:54:45,993
Place your bets here.

718
00:54:59,632 --> 00:55:00,758
Yes!

719
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:02,718
This place is great!

720
00:55:03,427 --> 00:55:04,679
Okay.

721
00:55:07,056 --> 00:55:08,656
Maz said this Master Codebreaker

722
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:10,685
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

723
00:55:10,768 --> 00:55:12,520
Let's find him and get out of here.

724
00:55:12,687 --> 00:55:13,688
Well played.

725
00:55:13,855 --> 00:55:14,856
The house wins.

726
00:55:15,898 --> 00:55:16,900
Where are your manners, more like?

727
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:17,984
Come on!

728
00:55:41,883 --> 00:55:42,759
We've covered this whole casino.

729
00:55:42,842 --> 00:55:43,843
Zero red plom blooms.

730
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,136
Where is this guy?

731
00:55:50,474 --> 00:55:52,185
Were those what I think they were?

732
00:55:59,358 --> 00:56:00,401
What are those things?

733
00:56:00,484 --> 00:56:01,485
Fathiers.

734
00:56:02,278 --> 00:56:03,738
I've never seen a real one.

735
00:56:04,488 --> 00:56:05,907
Look, this whole place is beautiful.

736
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:07,116
I mean, come on.

737
00:56:07,909 --> 00:56:09,493
Why do you hate it so much?

738
00:56:10,494 --> 00:56:11,787
Look closer.

739
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:19,142
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

740
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:23,174
The First Order stripped our ore

741
00:56:23,257 --> 00:56:24,884
to finance their military...

742
00:56:26,135 --> 00:56:28,387
then shelled us to test their weapons.

743
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:36,312
They took everything we had.

744
00:56:37,688 --> 00:56:39,899
And who do you think these people are?

745
00:56:40,733 --> 00:56:42,683
There's only one business in the galaxy

746
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:44,077
that'll get you this rich.

747
00:56:44,862 --> 00:56:45,947
War.

748
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:48,783
Selling weapons to the First Order.

749
00:56:50,826 --> 00:56:51,827
I wish...

750
00:56:51,994 --> 00:56:53,246
I could put my fist through

751
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:55,540
this whole lousy, beautiful town.

752
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:04,006
Red plom bloom!

753
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:13,391
Red plom bloom!

754
00:57:13,516 --> 00:57:14,666
The Master Codebreaker!

755
00:57:21,148 --> 00:57:22,898
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

756
00:57:23,901 --> 00:57:24,902
All right.

757
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:29,365
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

758
00:57:29,448 --> 00:57:30,450
You have the right to remain...

759
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:32,744
- What was that?
- No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

760
00:57:32,827 --> 00:57:33,828
I'm on a roll.

761
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,267
Lesson two.

762
00:59:19,433 --> 00:59:20,768
Now that they're extinct,

763
00:59:20,935 --> 00:59:23,521
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

764
00:59:24,105 --> 00:59:26,905
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds...

765
00:59:27,316 --> 00:59:29,318
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

766
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:30,862
Hypocrisy, hubris.

767
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:31,946
That's not true.

768
00:59:32,154 --> 00:59:33,198
At the height of their powers,

769
00:59:33,281 --> 00:59:34,783
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise...

770
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:36,742
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

771
00:59:37,118 --> 00:59:39,120
It was a Jedi Master
who was responsible...

772
00:59:39,203 --> 00:59:42,331
for the training
and creation of Darth Vader.

773
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:43,958
And a Jedi who saved him.

774
00:59:44,709 --> 00:59:46,336
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

775
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:48,629
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

776
00:59:48,796 --> 00:59:49,923
You believed that he wasn't gone.

777
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:51,382
That he could be turned.

778
00:59:51,757 --> 00:59:53,426
And I became a legend.

779
00:59:54,802 --> 00:59:56,971
For many years, there was balance...

780
00:59:57,138 --> 00:59:58,472
and then I saw...

781
00:59:58,806 --> 00:59:59,807
Ben.

782
01:00:01,267 --> 01:00:02,602
My nephew...

783
01:00:02,768 --> 01:00:04,937
with that mighty Skywalker blood.

784
01:00:05,104 --> 01:00:06,439
And in my hubris...

785
01:00:06,689 --> 01:00:09,775
I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.

786
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:14,238
Han was Han about it, but...

787
01:00:16,866 --> 01:00:18,367
Leia...

788
01:00:19,827 --> 01:00:22,163
trusted me with her son.

789
01:00:22,955 --> 01:00:23,956
I took him...

790
01:00:24,999 --> 01:00:26,751
and a dozen students...

791
01:00:27,793 --> 01:00:29,295
and began a training temple.

792
01:00:31,506 --> 01:00:34,175
By the time I realized I was no match

793
01:00:34,342 --> 01:00:36,719
for the darkness rising in him...

794
01:00:37,428 --> 01:00:38,971
it was too late.

795
01:00:40,306 --> 01:00:41,641
What happened?

796
01:00:45,102 --> 01:00:46,562
I went to confront him.

797
01:00:48,856 --> 01:00:50,525
And he turned on me.

798
01:00:51,025 --> 01:00:52,401
Ben, no!

799
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:57,949
He must have thought I was dead.

800
01:00:59,325 --> 01:01:00,535
When I came to...

801
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:04,330
the temple was burning.

802
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,459
He had vanished
with a handful of my students.

803
01:01:09,544 --> 01:01:11,712
And slaughtered the rest.

804
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:15,174
Leia blamed Snoke, but...

805
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:17,093
it was me.

806
01:01:17,802 --> 01:01:19,220
I failed.

807
01:01:22,723 --> 01:01:25,768
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

808
01:01:26,686 --> 01:01:28,604
Jedi Master.

809
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:35,611
A legend.

810
01:01:37,822 --> 01:01:40,074
The galaxy may need a legend.

811
01:01:44,704 --> 01:01:48,958
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

812
01:01:54,797 --> 01:01:56,507
And you didn't fail Kylo.

813
01:01:56,716 --> 01:01:58,384
Kylo failed you.

814
01:01:59,093 --> 01:02:00,720
I won't.

815
01:02:21,449 --> 01:02:24,285
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

816
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:26,885
But their medical frigate
is out of fuel...

817
01:02:27,747 --> 01:02:29,498
and its shields are down.

818
01:02:29,665 --> 01:02:31,542
The beginning of their end.

819
01:02:33,002 --> 01:02:34,712
Destroy it.

820
01:02:37,798 --> 01:02:39,717
The last of our crew has been evacuated

821
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,052
and heading your way.

822
01:02:42,178 --> 01:02:43,763
It's been an honor, admiral.

823
01:02:43,971 --> 01:02:45,848
Godspeed, Rebels!

824
01:02:49,227 --> 01:02:50,228
Admiral...

825
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:52,939
fuel reserves at six hours.

826
01:02:54,732 --> 01:02:56,776
Maintain our current course.

827
01:02:57,610 --> 01:02:59,237
Steady on.

828
01:03:04,367 --> 01:03:05,368
Finn...

829
01:03:05,535 --> 01:03:07,620
Rose, where are you guys?

830
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,168
Deal me in.

831
01:03:17,463 --> 01:03:18,464
Thanks.

832
01:03:20,132 --> 01:03:23,427
Finn, the fleet is running on fumes.

833
01:03:24,345 --> 01:03:25,972
Without a codebreaker to break us

834
01:03:26,055 --> 01:03:27,555
onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

835
01:03:28,432 --> 01:03:29,982
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

836
01:03:30,434 --> 01:03:31,728
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,

837
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:33,062
our plan is shot.

838
01:03:35,147 --> 01:03:36,440
I can do it.

839
01:03:40,736 --> 01:03:41,737
What?

840
01:03:43,239 --> 01:03:44,407
What?

841
01:03:45,366 --> 01:03:46,367
What?

842
01:03:46,534 --> 01:03:48,077
Sorry, I just...

843
01:03:48,536 --> 01:03:49,954
couldn't help but overhear

844
01:03:50,121 --> 01:03:53,624
all the stuff that you
were saying really loudly...

845
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:55,692
while I was trying to sleep.

846
01:03:57,879 --> 01:03:59,255
Codebreaker?

847
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:01,632
Thief?

848
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:03,801
I can do it.

849
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:06,721
We're not talking about
picking pockets, okay?

850
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:09,682
Yeah.

851
01:04:11,642 --> 01:04:13,592
Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend.

852
01:04:14,312 --> 01:04:17,815
Me and the First Order codeage
go way back.

853
01:04:19,775 --> 01:04:20,776
And...

854
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:24,405
if the price is right...

855
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:30,536
I could break you
into old man Snoke's boudoir.

856
01:04:32,371 --> 01:04:34,248
- No.
- We're... We got it covered.

857
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:39,170
Ha-tuk-ga.

858
01:04:52,642 --> 01:04:54,393
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

859
01:04:55,978 --> 01:04:57,678
We gotta get out of here!
This way!

860
01:04:57,772 --> 01:04:58,856
Why you little...

861
01:05:03,986 --> 01:05:05,780
Did you do this?

862
01:05:08,908 --> 01:05:09,909
Hey, hands up!

863
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,161
Hands up!

864
01:05:12,245 --> 01:05:13,246
Yeah, man.

865
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:31,013
What's your story, roundie?

866
01:05:31,764 --> 01:05:32,807
They went this way!

867
01:05:37,603 --> 01:05:38,688
Lock down all the exits.

868
01:05:38,771 --> 01:05:39,772
Wait.

869
01:05:44,151 --> 01:05:45,778
That smelled great.

870
01:05:46,028 --> 01:05:48,228
Those cops will be here
any minute. What now?

871
01:06:21,022 --> 01:06:22,815
No, wait. Please, don't!

872
01:06:30,198 --> 01:06:31,498
We're with the Resistance.

873
01:06:37,455 --> 01:06:39,415
Roger that.
Checking the stables now.

874
01:06:46,547 --> 01:06:47,548
This way.

875
01:06:47,632 --> 01:06:49,282
They must have come through here.

876
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:02,897
Go, go, go!

877
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:11,864
Stop enjoying this!
Stop enjoying this!

878
01:07:17,495 --> 01:07:19,664
We've got them.
They're not going anywhere.

879
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:05,841
Move, move, move!
Get out of the way!

880
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,630
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

881
01:08:11,757 --> 01:08:12,758
We need cover!

882
01:08:23,603 --> 01:08:24,770
Too much cover!

883
01:08:37,408 --> 01:08:38,408
There it is!

884
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:42,037
No!

885
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:43,122
Come on!

886
01:08:58,179 --> 01:09:00,029
Let the herd go.
Stick with the perps.

887
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:06,770
Where'd they go?

888
01:09:10,066 --> 01:09:11,067
I think we lost him!

889
01:09:11,274 --> 01:09:13,111
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

890
01:09:13,194 --> 01:09:14,319
Cliff!

891
01:09:24,287 --> 01:09:25,288
We're trapped.

892
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,200
It was worth it, though.

893
01:09:30,127 --> 01:09:31,379
To tear up that town...

894
01:09:31,754 --> 01:09:33,005
make 'em hurt.

895
01:09:42,305 --> 01:09:43,307
Go.

896
01:09:48,729 --> 01:09:49,897
Now it's worth it.

897
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:01,242
There they are.

898
01:10:06,706 --> 01:10:07,707
BB-8!

899
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:09,390
Wait, are you flying that thing?

900
01:10:15,673 --> 01:10:17,008
Need a lift?

901
01:11:11,062 --> 01:11:12,063
Luke.

902
01:11:13,231 --> 01:11:14,357
Leia.

903
01:11:23,241 --> 01:11:25,117
I'd rather not do this now.

904
01:11:25,826 --> 01:11:27,161
Yeah, me, too.

905
01:11:29,539 --> 01:11:31,082
Why did you hate your father?

906
01:11:35,503 --> 01:11:36,504
Do you have something,

907
01:11:36,587 --> 01:11:38,437
a cowl or something you could put on?

908
01:11:41,843 --> 01:11:44,543
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

909
01:11:45,721 --> 01:11:47,015
You had a father who loved you...

910
01:11:47,098 --> 01:11:48,348
he gave a damn about you.

911
01:11:48,432 --> 01:11:49,433
I didn't hate him.

912
01:11:49,684 --> 01:11:50,685
Then why?

913
01:11:50,893 --> 01:11:51,894
Why what?

914
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:56,816
Why what? Say it.

915
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,485
Why did you...

916
01:12:00,278 --> 01:12:01,821
Why did you kill him?

917
01:12:02,697 --> 01:12:03,906
I don't understand.

918
01:12:04,073 --> 01:12:05,074
No?

919
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,993
Your parents threw you away like garbage.

920
01:12:07,076 --> 01:12:09,078
- They didn't!
- They did.

921
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:11,038
But you can't stop needing them.

922
01:12:11,205 --> 01:12:12,605
It's your greatest weakness.

923
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:14,459
Looking for them everywhere...

924
01:12:14,542 --> 01:12:15,668
in Han Solo...

925
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,962
now in Skywalker.

926
01:12:21,424 --> 01:12:23,468
Did he tell you what happened that night?

927
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,552
Yes.

928
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:27,722
No.

929
01:12:29,473 --> 01:12:31,142
He had sensed my power...

930
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:34,187
as he senses yours.

931
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:37,148
And he feared it.

932
01:12:53,956 --> 01:12:55,208
Liar.

933
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:01,005
Let the past die.

934
01:13:02,715 --> 01:13:04,967
Kill it if you have to.

935
01:13:07,512 --> 01:13:10,262
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

936
01:13:53,266 --> 01:13:54,267
No!

937
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:55,351
No!

938
01:14:35,850 --> 01:14:37,268
Rey?

939
01:15:06,339 --> 01:15:09,008
I should have felt trapped or panicked.

940
01:15:09,342 --> 01:15:10,635
But I didn't.

941
01:15:14,055 --> 01:15:15,098
This didn't go on forever,

942
01:15:15,181 --> 01:15:17,308
I knew it was leading somewhere.

943
01:15:18,059 --> 01:15:20,909
And that, at the end, it would
show me what I came to see.

944
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:24,106
Rey.

945
01:15:32,698 --> 01:15:34,784
Let me see them.

946
01:15:35,284 --> 01:15:37,245
My parents...

947
01:15:37,453 --> 01:15:39,497
please.

948
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:16,742
I thought I'd find answers here.

949
01:16:18,327 --> 01:16:19,704
I was wrong.

950
01:16:22,248 --> 01:16:24,000
I'd never felt so alone.

951
01:16:26,544 --> 01:16:27,920
You're not alone.

952
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:34,385
Neither are you.

953
01:16:35,511 --> 01:16:36,721
Rey?

954
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:46,147
It isn't too late.

955
01:17:43,913 --> 01:17:44,914
Stop!

956
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:55,424
Is it true?

957
01:17:55,591 --> 01:17:57,260
Did you try to murder him?

958
01:17:57,510 --> 01:17:59,846
Leave this island now!

959
01:18:00,096 --> 01:18:01,222
Stop.

960
01:18:02,598 --> 01:18:03,599
Stop!

961
01:18:08,062 --> 01:18:09,146
Did you do it?

962
01:18:09,313 --> 01:18:11,315
Did you create Kylo Ren?

963
01:18:41,012 --> 01:18:42,555
Tell me the truth.

964
01:18:48,811 --> 01:18:50,730
I saw darkness.

965
01:18:52,565 --> 01:18:54,483
I'd sensed it building in him.

966
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:57,278
I'd seen it in moments
during his training.

967
01:18:57,820 --> 01:18:59,655
But then I looked inside...

968
01:19:00,072 --> 01:19:02,867
and it was beyond what I ever imagined.

969
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:10,249
Snoke had already turned his heart.

970
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:14,504
He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death...

971
01:19:14,879 --> 01:19:16,047
and the end of everything I love

972
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:17,798
because of what he will become.

973
01:19:17,965 --> 01:19:19,843
And for the briefest moment
of pure instinct...

974
01:19:19,926 --> 01:19:21,226
I thought I could stop it.

975
01:19:24,222 --> 01:19:26,682
It passed like a fleeting shadow.

976
01:19:27,558 --> 01:19:29,393
And I was left with shame...

977
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,730
and with consequence.

978
01:19:33,481 --> 01:19:35,316
And the last thing I saw...

979
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:37,735
were the eyes of a frightened boy

980
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:40,321
whose master had failed him.

981
01:19:42,198 --> 01:19:43,199
Ben, no!

982
01:19:49,956 --> 01:19:52,250
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

983
01:19:52,333 --> 01:19:53,334
It wasn't.

984
01:19:53,626 --> 01:19:55,419
There's still conflict in him.

985
01:19:55,670 --> 01:19:56,838
If he were turned from the dark side,

986
01:19:56,921 --> 01:19:58,221
that could shift the tide.

987
01:19:58,381 --> 01:20:00,132
This could be how we win.

988
01:20:00,383 --> 01:20:03,302
This is not going to go the way you think.

989
01:20:03,803 --> 01:20:05,054
It is.

990
01:20:05,263 --> 01:20:08,015
Just now when we touched hands...

991
01:20:08,182 --> 01:20:09,392
I saw his future.

992
01:20:10,434 --> 01:20:12,061
As solid as I'm seeing you.

993
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:16,107
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

994
01:20:16,357 --> 01:20:17,400
Rey...

995
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:19,944
don't do this.

996
01:20:35,835 --> 01:20:37,420
Then he's our last hope.

997
01:21:18,544 --> 01:21:19,921
Master Yoda.

998
01:21:20,796 --> 01:21:23,257
Young Skywalker.

999
01:21:25,510 --> 01:21:26,928
I'm ending all of this.

1000
01:21:27,303 --> 01:21:29,764
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

1001
01:21:30,014 --> 01:21:31,164
I'm gonna burn it down.

1002
01:22:08,803 --> 01:22:09,887
Skywalker.

1003
01:22:10,054 --> 01:22:11,055
Missed you, have I.

1004
01:22:24,277 --> 01:22:25,945
So it is time...

1005
01:22:27,488 --> 01:22:29,282
for the Jedi Order to end.

1006
01:22:29,448 --> 01:22:31,701
Time it is.

1007
01:22:36,414 --> 01:22:41,252
For you to look past a pile of old books.

1008
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:43,838
The sacred Jedi texts.

1009
01:22:44,005 --> 01:22:46,174
Oh. Read them, have you?

1010
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:48,342
- Well, I...
- Page-turners...

1011
01:22:48,509 --> 01:22:49,760
they were not.

1012
01:22:50,428 --> 01:22:52,305
Yes, yes, yes.

1013
01:22:52,471 --> 01:22:53,806
Wisdom they held...

1014
01:22:53,973 --> 01:22:57,435
but that library contained
nothing that the girl Rey...

1015
01:22:57,685 --> 01:22:59,520
does not already possess.

1016
01:23:02,690 --> 01:23:04,358
Skywalker...

1017
01:23:05,359 --> 01:23:07,195
still looking to the horizon.

1018
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:09,864
Never here, now, hmm?

1019
01:23:10,031 --> 01:23:12,575
The need in front of your nose.

1020
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:17,914
I was weak.

1021
01:23:19,165 --> 01:23:20,166
Unwise.

1022
01:23:20,333 --> 01:23:22,835
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

1023
01:23:23,628 --> 01:23:26,047
Lose Rey, we must not.

1024
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:29,300
I can't be what she needs me to be.

1025
01:23:29,926 --> 01:23:32,094
Heeded my words not, did you?

1026
01:23:32,553 --> 01:23:35,097
Pass on what you have learned.

1027
01:23:35,264 --> 01:23:36,265
Strength...

1028
01:23:36,432 --> 01:23:37,433
mastery...

1029
01:23:38,309 --> 01:23:39,936
But weakness...

1030
01:23:40,102 --> 01:23:41,479
folly...

1031
01:23:41,646 --> 01:23:42,647
failure also.

1032
01:23:42,730 --> 01:23:45,775
Yes, failure most of all.

1033
01:23:46,025 --> 01:23:48,861
The greatest teacher, failure is.

1034
01:23:58,246 --> 01:23:59,247
Luke...

1035
01:24:01,791 --> 01:24:05,211
we are what they grow beyond.

1036
01:24:05,962 --> 01:24:10,174
That is the true burden of all masters.

1037
01:24:23,479 --> 01:24:25,523
Four parsecs to go.
This thing really cooks.

1038
01:24:25,606 --> 01:24:27,275
I just hope we're in time.

1039
01:24:27,441 --> 01:24:29,041
You can actually do this, right?

1040
01:24:29,402 --> 01:24:31,404
Yeah, about that...

1041
01:24:35,157 --> 01:24:38,619
Guys, I can do it.

1042
01:24:39,537 --> 01:24:42,287
But there exists a pre-"do it"
conversation about price.

1043
01:24:42,874 --> 01:24:43,875
Once we're done,

1044
01:24:43,958 --> 01:24:46,169
the Resistance will give you
whatever you want.

1045
01:24:46,252 --> 01:24:47,552
What you got deposit-wise?

1046
01:24:48,171 --> 01:24:50,339
Are you kidding me?
Look at us.

1047
01:24:51,465 --> 01:24:53,176
Is that Haysian smelt?

1048
01:24:55,845 --> 01:24:57,180
That's something.

1049
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,641
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

1050
01:24:59,724 --> 01:25:00,850
That should be enough.

1051
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,450
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

1052
01:25:03,394 --> 01:25:06,898
But no something, no doing.

1053
01:25:07,064 --> 01:25:08,065
Okay, listen here...

1054
01:25:08,191 --> 01:25:09,192
you've got...

1055
01:25:09,692 --> 01:25:11,152
Do it.

1056
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,032
Now I can help.

1057
01:25:18,576 --> 01:25:19,619
Give it back.

1058
01:25:21,078 --> 01:25:22,079
What?

1059
01:25:22,205 --> 01:25:24,290
Give it back!

1060
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:26,793
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

1061
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:29,879
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

1062
01:25:32,381 --> 01:25:33,424
It's not your ship.

1063
01:25:35,259 --> 01:25:36,302
He says I stole it.

1064
01:25:36,552 --> 01:25:37,637
Yeah, I got that.

1065
01:25:37,803 --> 01:25:38,804
We stole it.

1066
01:25:40,556 --> 01:25:42,808
At least you're stealing
from the bad guys...

1067
01:25:43,434 --> 01:25:44,484
and helping the good.

1068
01:25:44,602 --> 01:25:46,521
Good guys, bad guys...

1069
01:25:46,729 --> 01:25:48,773
made-up words.

1070
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:53,069
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk-uh.

1071
01:25:56,155 --> 01:25:58,366
This guy was an arms dealer.

1072
01:25:59,158 --> 01:26:02,370
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

1073
01:26:06,707 --> 01:26:08,167
And the good.

1074
01:26:09,627 --> 01:26:12,505
Finn, let me learn you something big.

1075
01:26:13,923 --> 01:26:16,008
It's all a machine, partner.

1076
01:26:17,802 --> 01:26:20,513
Live free, don't join.

1077
01:26:32,608 --> 01:26:35,027
That was the last of their support ships.

1078
01:26:35,194 --> 01:26:36,738
It's just their main cruiser now.

1079
01:26:36,821 --> 01:26:38,281
And their fuel reserve?

1080
01:26:38,447 --> 01:26:40,157
By our calculation...

1081
01:26:40,324 --> 01:26:41,742
critical.

1082
01:26:45,872 --> 01:26:46,873
She in there?

1083
01:26:46,956 --> 01:26:47,957
The admiral's banned you from the bridge.

1084
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,626
- Let's not have a scene.
- No, let's.

1085
01:26:49,709 --> 01:26:50,459
Holdo?

1086
01:26:50,543 --> 01:26:51,419
Captain, you're not allowed in here.

1087
01:26:51,502 --> 01:26:52,253
Flyboy.

1088
01:26:52,336 --> 01:26:53,629
Cut it, lady.

1089
01:26:54,297 --> 01:26:56,132
We had a fleet,
now we're down to one ship,

1090
01:26:56,215 --> 01:26:57,758
and you've told us nothing!

1091
01:26:58,301 --> 01:27:01,512
Tell us that we have a plan!

1092
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:02,680
That there's hope!

1093
01:27:02,847 --> 01:27:04,265
When I served under Leia...

1094
01:27:04,515 --> 01:27:06,893
she would say, hope is like the sun.

1095
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:09,562
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

1096
01:27:09,812 --> 01:27:11,939
You'll never make it through the night.

1097
01:27:12,398 --> 01:27:13,733
Yes.

1098
01:27:21,824 --> 01:27:23,826
Are you fueling up the transports?

1099
01:27:29,373 --> 01:27:30,666
You are.

1100
01:27:31,375 --> 01:27:32,627
All of them?

1101
01:27:33,878 --> 01:27:36,464
We're abandoning ship?
Is that...

1102
01:27:36,881 --> 01:27:39,381
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

1103
01:27:39,675 --> 01:27:40,676
Coward!

1104
01:27:41,385 --> 01:27:44,388
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

1105
01:27:44,472 --> 01:27:46,682
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1106
01:27:46,807 --> 01:27:47,851
We don't stand a chance.

1107
01:27:47,934 --> 01:27:49,560
No, you are not just a coward...

1108
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:51,229
you are a traitor.

1109
01:27:51,979 --> 01:27:54,148
Get this man off my bridge.

1110
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:03,280
Finn, Holdo's loading
the crew in the shuttle.

1111
01:28:03,407 --> 01:28:05,368
She's going to abandon ship.
Where are you?

1112
01:28:05,451 --> 01:28:07,162
Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet.

1113
01:28:07,245 --> 01:28:08,412
We're so close.

1114
01:28:08,663 --> 01:28:09,706
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1115
01:28:09,789 --> 01:28:11,832
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1116
01:28:12,333 --> 01:28:13,585
We can shut the tracker down.

1117
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:15,503
Just buy us a little more time.

1118
01:28:16,587 --> 01:28:18,172
All right. Hurry.

1119
01:28:23,511 --> 01:28:25,263
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

1120
01:28:25,346 --> 01:28:26,681
Stay there until you get my signal

1121
01:28:26,764 --> 01:28:28,099
for where to rendezvous.

1122
01:28:30,309 --> 01:28:32,603
If you see Finn before I do...

1123
01:28:32,770 --> 01:28:33,771
tell him...

1124
01:28:36,065 --> 01:28:37,692
Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.

1125
01:29:44,592 --> 01:29:47,192
Cloaking our approach.
We should be off their scopes.

1126
01:29:47,845 --> 01:29:50,181
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1127
01:29:50,431 --> 01:29:51,974
Blip bloppity bloop...

1128
01:29:53,017 --> 01:29:54,936
and slip right through.

1129
01:30:13,412 --> 01:30:16,541
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1130
01:30:16,791 --> 01:30:17,917
They are trying to save us.

1131
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,711
This is our best chance for escape.

1132
01:30:19,794 --> 01:30:21,796
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

1133
01:30:21,879 --> 01:30:24,257
You have bet the survival
of the Resistance...

1134
01:30:24,507 --> 01:30:27,176
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1135
01:30:27,343 --> 01:30:28,511
There's no time now.

1136
01:30:28,678 --> 01:30:29,846
We have to get clear of the cruiser.

1137
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:31,347
- Load the transports.
- Right away, admiral.

1138
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:33,130
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1139
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:34,934
Vice Admiral Holdo...

1140
01:30:35,184 --> 01:30:37,034
I am relieving you of your command...

1141
01:30:37,144 --> 01:30:40,314
for the survival of this ship,
its crew, and the Resistance.

1142
01:30:41,232 --> 01:30:43,401
I hope you understand what you're doing.

1143
01:30:43,985 --> 01:30:44,986
Yeah.

1144
01:30:45,194 --> 01:30:46,394
I'm going to the bridge.

1145
01:30:46,487 --> 01:30:48,489
If they move, stun them.

1146
01:31:08,467 --> 01:31:10,178
It's at least three cycles so far.

1147
01:31:10,344 --> 01:31:11,844
Yes, sir.
We are working on it.

1148
01:31:11,929 --> 01:31:12,972
Very good.

1149
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:20,563
I will do my best, sir.

1150
01:31:31,157 --> 01:31:32,325
Almost there.

1151
01:31:41,542 --> 01:31:43,294
You don't have to do this.

1152
01:31:43,836 --> 01:31:45,463
I feel the conflict in you.

1153
01:31:45,630 --> 01:31:47,298
It's tearing you apart.

1154
01:31:48,382 --> 01:31:50,718
Ben, when we touched hands...

1155
01:31:50,968 --> 01:31:52,428
I saw your future.

1156
01:31:52,595 --> 01:31:55,014
Just the shape of it, but solid and clear.

1157
01:31:55,556 --> 01:31:57,808
You will not bow before Snoke.

1158
01:32:00,853 --> 01:32:02,396
You'll turn.

1159
01:32:04,649 --> 01:32:06,275
I'll help you.

1160
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:08,361
I saw it.

1161
01:32:08,528 --> 01:32:10,154
I saw something, too.

1162
01:32:11,614 --> 01:32:12,782
Because of what I saw...

1163
01:32:12,865 --> 01:32:15,615
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

1164
01:32:15,952 --> 01:32:17,745
You'll stand with me.

1165
01:32:18,454 --> 01:32:19,455
Rey...

1166
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:22,917
I saw who your parents are.

1167
01:32:37,807 --> 01:32:42,144
Well done, my good
and faithful apprentice.

1168
01:32:42,478 --> 01:32:46,232
My faith in you is restored.

1169
01:32:47,608 --> 01:32:49,735
Young Rey.

1170
01:32:52,071 --> 01:32:53,531
Welcome.

1171
01:32:58,911 --> 01:33:00,162
So this is it.

1172
01:33:00,329 --> 01:33:02,206
The tracker's right behind this door.

1173
01:33:15,428 --> 01:33:17,471
Haysian smelt.

1174
01:33:17,972 --> 01:33:19,390
Best conductor.

1175
01:33:28,065 --> 01:33:29,442
And you're welcome.

1176
01:33:31,569 --> 01:33:33,404
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

1177
01:33:33,487 --> 01:33:35,156
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

1178
01:33:35,239 --> 01:33:36,240
Course you do.

1179
01:33:36,324 --> 01:33:38,117
BB-8, tell me something good.

1180
01:33:39,994 --> 01:33:41,204
Poe, we're almost there.

1181
01:33:41,454 --> 01:33:42,664
Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.

1182
01:33:42,747 --> 01:33:44,957
Yeah, I'm on it, pal.
You just hurry.

1183
01:33:47,251 --> 01:33:49,170
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

1184
01:33:49,253 --> 01:33:50,755
Commander... Captain Dameron,

1185
01:33:50,922 --> 01:33:52,715
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1186
01:33:52,882 --> 01:33:54,050
Yeah, we spoke.

1187
01:33:55,510 --> 01:33:57,720
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1188
01:33:57,887 --> 01:33:59,737
Good instinct, Threepio.
Go with that.

1189
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:13,611
Seal that door!

1190
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:17,323
We're running out of time.

1191
01:34:17,406 --> 01:34:18,658
Come on, how's it going?

1192
01:34:18,824 --> 01:34:20,326
Almost there.

1193
01:34:21,410 --> 01:34:23,329
Threepio, where do you think you're going?

1194
01:34:23,412 --> 01:34:25,415
It would be quite against
my programming...

1195
01:34:25,498 --> 01:34:27,291
- to be party to a mutiny.
- Hey!

1196
01:34:27,542 --> 01:34:29,293
It is not correct protocol.

1197
01:34:30,837 --> 01:34:32,505
Neither is this!

1198
01:34:32,588 --> 01:34:33,381
Finn?

1199
01:34:33,464 --> 01:34:34,716
We're ready to make the jump!

1200
01:34:34,799 --> 01:34:36,050
Now or never.

1201
01:34:39,512 --> 01:34:40,513
Now.

1202
01:34:48,229 --> 01:34:49,230
You're up.

1203
01:35:06,956 --> 01:35:07,999
You there, hands up!

1204
01:35:08,249 --> 01:35:09,250
Watch 'em, watch 'em.

1205
01:35:09,333 --> 01:35:11,044
- Drop your weapons, now!
- Hands up, Rebel scum.

1206
01:35:11,127 --> 01:35:12,795
Get down! I said, down!

1207
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:24,432
FN-2187.

1208
01:35:26,475 --> 01:35:28,519
So good to have you back.

1209
01:35:29,562 --> 01:35:30,688
They didn't make it.

1210
01:35:44,702 --> 01:35:45,703
Leia.

1211
01:35:57,298 --> 01:35:58,383
Please board the transports

1212
01:35:58,466 --> 01:36:00,968
according to your evacuation designation.

1213
01:36:01,135 --> 01:36:02,220
All transports must be cleared...

1214
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:03,680
Okay, help me push him up, guys.

1215
01:36:03,763 --> 01:36:05,223
That one's a troublemaker.

1216
01:36:05,890 --> 01:36:07,141
I like him.

1217
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:08,893
Me, too.

1218
01:36:09,685 --> 01:36:11,562
Now, time to board your transport.

1219
01:36:12,772 --> 01:36:14,357
For the transports to escape...

1220
01:36:15,399 --> 01:36:18,361
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

1221
01:36:22,990 --> 01:36:24,534
Too many losses.

1222
01:36:26,202 --> 01:36:28,287
I can't take any more.

1223
01:36:28,704 --> 01:36:29,914
Sure you can.

1224
01:36:31,457 --> 01:36:33,125
You taught me how.

1225
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:37,129
May the Force be...

1226
01:36:39,173 --> 01:36:40,842
You go on.
I've said it enough.

1227
01:36:42,635 --> 01:36:46,055
May the Force be with you always.

1228
01:36:52,854 --> 01:36:56,065
Cloaking device activated.
We should be off their scopes.

1229
01:36:56,232 --> 01:36:58,484
Let's hope this works.

1230
01:37:15,251 --> 01:37:17,461
Come closer, child.

1231
01:37:20,256 --> 01:37:22,717
So much strength.

1232
01:37:23,134 --> 01:37:26,220
Darkness rises...

1233
01:37:26,429 --> 01:37:30,099
and light to meet it.

1234
01:37:31,058 --> 01:37:32,727
I warned my young apprentice...

1235
01:37:32,977 --> 01:37:34,937
that as he grew stronger...

1236
01:37:35,271 --> 01:37:37,648
his equal in the light would rise.

1237
01:37:40,443 --> 01:37:41,527
Skywalker...

1238
01:37:41,986 --> 01:37:43,487
I assumed...

1239
01:37:44,572 --> 01:37:45,573
wrongly.

1240
01:37:48,784 --> 01:37:50,536
Closer, I said.

1241
01:37:57,376 --> 01:37:59,086
You underestimate Skywalker...

1242
01:37:59,837 --> 01:38:00,922
and Ben Solo...

1243
01:38:01,631 --> 01:38:02,882
and me.

1244
01:38:03,549 --> 01:38:05,426
It will be your downfall.

1245
01:38:07,094 --> 01:38:09,013
Have you seen something?

1246
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:12,391
A weakness in my apprentice.

1247
01:38:12,642 --> 01:38:14,560
Is that why you came?

1248
01:38:17,313 --> 01:38:19,023
Young fool.

1249
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:22,735
It was I who bridged your minds.

1250
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:26,697
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1251
01:38:26,864 --> 01:38:28,414
I knew he was not strong enough

1252
01:38:28,533 --> 01:38:29,909
to hide it from you.

1253
01:38:30,117 --> 01:38:35,289
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

1254
01:38:39,001 --> 01:38:40,253
And now...

1255
01:38:40,795 --> 01:38:45,967
you will give me Skywalker.

1256
01:38:46,592 --> 01:38:49,053
Then I will kill you...

1257
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:52,181
with the cruelest stroke.

1258
01:38:53,015 --> 01:38:54,016
No.

1259
01:38:54,642 --> 01:38:55,893
Yes.

1260
01:38:59,939 --> 01:39:02,525
Give me...

1261
01:39:03,943 --> 01:39:05,570
everything.

1262
01:39:06,195 --> 01:39:07,905
No! No!

1263
01:39:08,698 --> 01:39:09,699
No!

1264
01:39:16,497 --> 01:39:18,124
No. No.

1265
01:39:18,291 --> 01:39:19,500
No, no, no!

1266
01:39:24,422 --> 01:39:25,506
Poe.

1267
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:32,221
What is that?

1268
01:39:32,388 --> 01:39:34,140
The mineral planet, Crait.

1269
01:39:34,348 --> 01:39:36,898
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

1270
01:39:37,226 --> 01:39:39,061
- That's a Rebel base?
- Abandoned...

1271
01:39:39,604 --> 01:39:40,605
but heavily armored...

1272
01:39:40,688 --> 01:39:41,689
with enough power

1273
01:39:41,772 --> 01:39:43,191
to get a distress signal to our allies...

1274
01:39:43,274 --> 01:39:44,442
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1275
01:39:44,525 --> 01:39:46,319
Holdo knew the First Order...

1276
01:39:46,569 --> 01:39:47,737
was tracking our big ship.

1277
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:50,656
They're not monitoring
for little transports.

1278
01:39:51,157 --> 01:39:53,451
So we could slip down
to the surface unnoticed...

1279
01:39:53,534 --> 01:39:56,829
and hide till the First Order passes.

1280
01:39:58,956 --> 01:39:59,999
That could work.

1281
01:40:01,709 --> 01:40:03,628
She was more interested

1282
01:40:03,836 --> 01:40:06,088
in protecting the light than she was...

1283
01:40:06,672 --> 01:40:09,133
seeming like a hero.

1284
01:40:21,145 --> 01:40:22,271
Godspeed...

1285
01:40:22,688 --> 01:40:24,148
Rebels.

1286
01:40:53,845 --> 01:40:55,221
Well done, Phasma.

1287
01:40:56,347 --> 01:40:59,100
Your ship and payment, as we agreed.

1288
01:41:06,983 --> 01:41:08,568
You lying snake.

1289
01:41:13,406 --> 01:41:15,700
We got caught...

1290
01:41:16,367 --> 01:41:18,452
I cut a deal.

1291
01:41:19,245 --> 01:41:20,288
Wait...

1292
01:41:20,955 --> 01:41:22,290
cut a deal with what?

1293
01:41:22,540 --> 01:41:24,501
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

1294
01:41:24,584 --> 01:41:27,003
We ran a decloaking scan,
and sure enough...

1295
01:41:27,170 --> 01:41:28,379
30 Resistance transports

1296
01:41:28,462 --> 01:41:30,262
have just launched from the cruiser.

1297
01:41:30,756 --> 01:41:32,842
He told us the truth.

1298
01:41:33,634 --> 01:41:35,344
Will wonders never cease?

1299
01:41:35,595 --> 01:41:36,596
No.

1300
01:41:36,971 --> 01:41:38,056
Our weapons are ready?

1301
01:41:38,139 --> 01:41:39,473
Ready and aimed, sir.

1302
01:41:40,349 --> 01:41:41,976
Fire at will.

1303
01:41:42,685 --> 01:41:44,228
Wait. No, no. No, you can't!

1304
01:41:44,854 --> 01:41:46,147
No!

1305
01:42:00,286 --> 01:42:01,871
Admiral, we're taking fire!

1306
01:42:02,121 --> 01:42:03,581
- Do we turn around?
- No, you're too far out.

1307
01:42:03,664 --> 01:42:05,291
Full speed to planetfall.

1308
01:42:05,458 --> 01:42:06,459
Full speed!

1309
01:42:12,632 --> 01:42:14,217
Well, well...

1310
01:42:14,383 --> 01:42:18,095
I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise.

1311
01:42:18,721 --> 01:42:21,307
We will give him and the Jedi Order...

1312
01:42:21,557 --> 01:42:23,851
the death he desires.

1313
01:42:24,477 --> 01:42:25,812
After the Rebels are gone...

1314
01:42:25,895 --> 01:42:27,313
we will go to his planet...

1315
01:42:27,522 --> 01:42:31,108
and obliterate the entire island.

1316
01:42:38,157 --> 01:42:39,492
Such spunk.

1317
01:42:40,243 --> 01:42:41,327
Look here now.

1318
01:42:48,793 --> 01:42:53,840
The entire Resistance
on those transports...

1319
01:42:54,507 --> 01:42:58,219
Soon they will all be gone.

1320
01:42:58,553 --> 01:43:01,597
For you, all is lost.

1321
01:43:06,811 --> 01:43:09,647
And still that fiery spit of hope.

1322
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:14,527
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1323
01:43:22,994 --> 01:43:24,287
And because of that...

1324
01:43:25,454 --> 01:43:26,789
you must die.

1325
01:43:29,667 --> 01:43:31,794
My worthy apprentice...

1326
01:43:32,044 --> 01:43:35,673
son of darkness,
heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1327
01:43:35,882 --> 01:43:39,218
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

1328
01:43:39,594 --> 01:43:42,054
Where there was weakness, strength.

1329
01:43:43,014 --> 01:43:44,557
Complete your training...

1330
01:43:44,932 --> 01:43:49,228
and fulfill your destiny.

1331
01:43:58,571 --> 01:44:00,239
I know what I have to do.

1332
01:44:02,283 --> 01:44:03,409
Ben.

1333
01:44:05,161 --> 01:44:07,246
You think you can turn him?

1334
01:44:07,830 --> 01:44:09,665
Pathetic child.

1335
01:44:11,209 --> 01:44:13,586
I cannot be betrayed...

1336
01:44:13,794 --> 01:44:15,671
I cannot be beaten.

1337
01:44:16,005 --> 01:44:18,382
I see his mind...

1338
01:44:18,633 --> 01:44:21,677
I see his every intent.

1339
01:44:21,844 --> 01:44:22,845
Yes.

1340
01:44:24,222 --> 01:44:27,558
I see him turning the lightsaber

1341
01:44:27,725 --> 01:44:29,894
to strike true.

1342
01:44:30,436 --> 01:44:31,479
And now...

1343
01:44:32,313 --> 01:44:33,814
foolish child...

1344
01:44:34,357 --> 01:44:36,108
he ignites it...

1345
01:44:36,984 --> 01:44:39,987
and kills his true enemy!

1346
01:45:21,654 --> 01:45:23,448
Come on, give it
full thrusters. Full speed!

1347
01:45:23,531 --> 01:45:24,949
I am, sir.

1348
01:45:27,702 --> 01:45:29,120
You murdering bastard!

1349
01:45:29,871 --> 01:45:31,914
Take it easy, Big F.

1350
01:45:32,373 --> 01:45:35,209
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

1351
01:45:35,918 --> 01:45:37,587
It's just business.

1352
01:45:40,131 --> 01:45:41,299
You're wrong.

1353
01:45:45,011 --> 01:45:46,053
Maybe.

1354
01:47:29,699 --> 01:47:30,700
Ben!

1355
01:47:42,795 --> 01:47:43,963
The fleet.

1356
01:47:44,130 --> 01:47:45,215
Order them to stop firing.

1357
01:47:45,298 --> 01:47:47,148
There's still time to save the fleet.

1358
01:47:55,808 --> 01:47:56,851
Ben?

1359
01:47:59,103 --> 01:48:01,063
It's time to let old things die.

1360
01:48:03,608 --> 01:48:04,901
Snoke...

1361
01:48:05,151 --> 01:48:06,319
Skywalker.

1362
01:48:08,362 --> 01:48:09,739
The Sith...

1363
01:48:10,406 --> 01:48:12,241
the Jedi, the Rebels...

1364
01:48:12,408 --> 01:48:13,784
Let it all die.

1365
01:48:14,410 --> 01:48:15,453
Rey.

1366
01:48:17,496 --> 01:48:18,831
I want you to join me.

1367
01:48:20,917 --> 01:48:23,586
We can rule together and bring
a new order to the galaxy.

1368
01:48:23,669 --> 01:48:25,046
Don't do this, Ben.

1369
01:48:26,214 --> 01:48:27,464
Please don't go this way.

1370
01:48:27,548 --> 01:48:29,800
No, no.
You're still holding on!

1371
01:48:29,967 --> 01:48:30,968
Let go!

1372
01:48:32,094 --> 01:48:34,394
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

1373
01:48:35,389 --> 01:48:36,724
Or have you always known?

1374
01:48:39,435 --> 01:48:40,985
And you've just hidden it away.

1375
01:48:42,980 --> 01:48:44,482
You know the truth.

1376
01:48:45,399 --> 01:48:46,651
Say it.

1377
01:48:49,904 --> 01:48:51,072
Say it.

1378
01:48:53,115 --> 01:48:54,659
They were nobody.

1379
01:48:54,825 --> 01:48:56,425
They were filthy junk traders...

1380
01:48:56,619 --> 01:48:58,419
who sold you off for drinking money.

1381
01:49:00,373 --> 01:49:01,374
They're dead...

1382
01:49:01,457 --> 01:49:03,584
in a paupers' grave in the Jakku desert.

1383
01:49:04,460 --> 01:49:06,420
You have no place in this story.

1384
01:49:06,671 --> 01:49:08,548
You come from nothing.
You're nothing.

1385
01:49:12,885 --> 01:49:14,136
But not to me.

1386
01:49:18,432 --> 01:49:19,433
Join me.

1387
01:49:32,738 --> 01:49:33,739
Please.

1388
01:50:04,187 --> 01:50:05,188
Sir...

1389
01:50:05,771 --> 01:50:06,773
the Resistance cruiser's

1390
01:50:06,856 --> 01:50:08,524
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1391
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,401
It's empty.

1392
01:50:10,568 --> 01:50:12,779
They're just trying to pull
our attention away.

1393
01:50:12,862 --> 01:50:14,030
Pathetic.

1394
01:50:14,280 --> 01:50:16,324
Keep your fire on the transports.

1395
01:50:44,227 --> 01:50:46,938
Execution by blaster is too good for them.

1396
01:50:47,188 --> 01:50:49,148
Let's make this hurt.

1397
01:50:54,862 --> 01:50:55,863
Finn.

1398
01:51:00,493 --> 01:51:02,036
On my command.

1399
01:51:06,874 --> 01:51:08,167
She's running away.

1400
01:51:10,294 --> 01:51:11,462
No, she isn't.

1401
01:51:25,268 --> 01:51:26,269
No!

1402
01:51:26,352 --> 01:51:28,271
Fire on that cruiser!

1403
01:51:42,326 --> 01:51:43,327
Execute.

1404
01:52:27,288 --> 01:52:28,372
Finn!

1405
01:52:28,539 --> 01:52:30,083
There's a shuttle back that way!

1406
01:52:30,166 --> 01:52:31,417
We gotta go!

1407
01:52:46,891 --> 01:52:47,892
Traitor!

1408
01:52:50,019 --> 01:52:51,020
What?

1409
01:53:14,418 --> 01:53:15,419
Finn!

1410
01:53:34,730 --> 01:53:36,399
You are a bug in the system.

1411
01:53:36,774 --> 01:53:37,942
Let's go, chrome dome.

1412
01:53:45,658 --> 01:53:46,784
Come on!

1413
01:53:56,627 --> 01:53:57,628
No!

1414
01:54:03,342 --> 01:54:04,343
Hey.

1415
01:54:20,443 --> 01:54:22,987
You were always scum.

1416
01:54:24,572 --> 01:54:26,073
Rebel scum.

1417
01:54:39,462 --> 01:54:40,463
Hey!

1418
01:54:40,546 --> 01:54:41,797
Need a lift?

1419
01:55:19,585 --> 01:55:21,629
What happened?

1420
01:55:22,296 --> 01:55:23,923
The girl murdered Snoke.

1421
01:55:28,427 --> 01:55:29,762
What happened?

1422
01:55:29,846 --> 01:55:32,473
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1423
01:55:32,890 --> 01:55:34,308
We know where she's going.

1424
01:55:35,309 --> 01:55:37,395
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

1425
01:55:37,478 --> 01:55:38,938
Let's finish this.

1426
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:40,857
Finish this?

1427
01:55:41,482 --> 01:55:43,526
Who do you think you're talking to?

1428
01:55:44,026 --> 01:55:46,487
You presume to command my army?

1429
01:55:47,280 --> 01:55:50,658
Our Supreme Leader is dead!
We have no ruler!

1430
01:55:55,162 --> 01:55:58,499
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1431
01:56:00,459 --> 01:56:03,588
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1432
01:56:21,397 --> 01:56:23,566
They're coming, shut the door.

1433
01:56:31,324 --> 01:56:32,992
Incoming!

1434
01:56:36,621 --> 01:56:38,497
Go! Go! Move!

1435
01:56:39,457 --> 01:56:41,667
Get that shield door down!

1436
01:56:57,266 --> 01:56:58,560
No! Wait, don't shoot!
It's us!

1437
01:56:58,643 --> 01:56:59,644
No! Don't shoot!

1438
01:56:59,852 --> 01:57:00,853
Hold your fire!

1439
01:57:01,062 --> 01:57:02,688
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

1440
01:57:05,608 --> 01:57:06,859
- Finn?
- Finn!

1441
01:57:07,401 --> 01:57:09,070
Rose! You're not dead!

1442
01:57:09,237 --> 01:57:10,446
Where's my droid?

1443
01:57:11,739 --> 01:57:12,782
Buddy!

1444
01:57:12,949 --> 01:57:15,034
I'm so glad to see you!

1445
01:57:16,869 --> 01:57:17,870
Wait, what?

1446
01:57:18,037 --> 01:57:19,080
Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

1447
01:57:19,163 --> 01:57:20,456
Is this all that's left?

1448
01:57:30,716 --> 01:57:31,760
All right, shields are up

1449
01:57:31,843 --> 01:57:33,261
so they can't hit us from orbit.

1450
01:57:33,344 --> 01:57:34,637
Use whatever power we've got left...

1451
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:36,848
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

1452
01:57:36,931 --> 01:57:38,558
Use my personal code.

1453
01:57:39,100 --> 01:57:41,936
If there are any allies
to the Resistance...

1454
01:57:42,478 --> 01:57:43,563
it's now or never.

1455
01:57:44,313 --> 01:57:46,232
Rose, what do you got?

1456
01:57:46,732 --> 01:57:48,318
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,

1457
01:57:48,401 --> 01:57:50,319
some half-gutted skim speeders.

1458
01:57:50,570 --> 01:57:51,571
Well...

1459
01:57:52,488 --> 01:57:54,324
let's just pray that big-ass door holds

1460
01:57:54,407 --> 01:57:55,957
long enough for us to get help.

1461
01:58:06,961 --> 01:58:08,713
A battering ram cannon.

1462
01:58:08,921 --> 01:58:10,548
A what now?

1463
01:58:10,965 --> 01:58:12,415
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

1464
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:14,500
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1465
01:58:15,052 --> 01:58:17,302
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

1466
01:58:18,014 --> 01:58:19,807
BB-8, what do you got?

1467
01:58:20,725 --> 01:58:23,811
BB-8 has analyzed the mine's schematics.

1468
01:58:24,061 --> 01:58:26,981
This is the only way in or out.

1469
01:58:34,614 --> 01:58:35,615
Come on.

1470
01:58:36,449 --> 01:58:37,658
We have allies.

1471
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:39,785
People believe in Leia.

1472
01:58:40,453 --> 01:58:42,353
They'll get our message, they'll come.

1473
01:58:42,580 --> 01:58:44,832
But we have to buy time.

1474
01:58:45,791 --> 01:58:48,336
We gotta take out that cannon.

1475
01:58:52,340 --> 01:58:53,382
On me! On me!

1476
01:58:54,634 --> 01:58:55,801
Move! Move!

1477
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:57,660
Go back!
Gather your weapons!

1478
01:58:57,803 --> 01:58:59,222
Get over here!

1479
01:58:59,472 --> 01:59:00,473
Hold your fire!

1480
01:59:17,740 --> 01:59:18,741
Salt.

1481
01:59:18,824 --> 01:59:20,117
Ground forces, incoming.

1482
01:59:20,284 --> 01:59:21,953
Copy that. On our way.

1483
01:59:39,428 --> 01:59:40,513
Engage your mono-ski.

1484
01:59:40,763 --> 01:59:42,223
The green toggle.

1485
01:59:52,275 --> 01:59:53,442
All right, listen up.

1486
01:59:53,609 --> 01:59:55,153
I don't like these rust buckets...

1487
01:59:55,236 --> 01:59:56,886
and I don't like our odds, but...

1488
01:59:57,238 --> 01:59:58,531
What the hell?

1489
01:59:58,781 --> 01:59:59,991
Just keep it tight...

1490
02:00:00,157 --> 02:00:01,284
and don't get drawn in too close

1491
02:00:01,367 --> 02:00:03,217
till they roll that cannon out front.

1492
02:00:22,889 --> 02:00:25,183
All right, ground forces,
lay down some fire!

1493
02:00:38,279 --> 02:00:40,156
Thirteen incoming light craft.

1494
02:00:40,323 --> 02:00:42,241
Shall we hold until we clear them?

1495
02:00:42,491 --> 02:00:45,286
No. The Resistance
is in that mine.

1496
02:00:45,828 --> 02:00:46,954
Push through.

1497
02:00:51,918 --> 02:00:53,294
Fighters, break off!

1498
02:01:03,429 --> 02:01:06,279
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

1499
02:01:21,739 --> 02:01:23,741
Rose, you got three right behind you!

1500
02:01:31,415 --> 02:01:32,416
I can't lose 'em!

1501
02:01:40,341 --> 02:01:41,342
Yeah!

1502
02:01:55,022 --> 02:01:56,148
I like this!

1503
02:02:04,782 --> 02:02:07,827
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

1504
02:02:08,035 --> 02:02:09,328
All fighters!

1505
02:02:16,669 --> 02:02:18,319
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

1506
02:02:18,421 --> 02:02:20,071
Draw them away from the speeders.

1507
02:02:25,636 --> 02:02:27,180
She drew 'em off! All of 'em!

1508
02:02:27,471 --> 02:02:28,973
Oh, they hate that ship!

1509
02:02:41,861 --> 02:02:42,862
Chewie!

1510
02:03:13,935 --> 02:03:14,936
There it is!

1511
02:03:20,149 --> 02:03:21,234
That is a big gun.

1512
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:22,750
Okay, it's heavily armored.

1513
02:03:22,944 --> 02:03:24,894
Our only shot is right down the throat.

1514
02:03:32,745 --> 02:03:34,497
The cannon's opening.
This is our chance.

1515
02:03:34,580 --> 02:03:35,832
All firepower on those speeders.

1516
02:03:35,915 --> 02:03:38,376
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

1517
02:03:45,258 --> 02:03:46,968
We're taking heavy losses.

1518
02:03:59,105 --> 02:04:01,065
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

1519
02:04:01,148 --> 02:04:02,948
All right, making my final approach.

1520
02:04:03,109 --> 02:04:04,486
Target in sight, guns are hot.

1521
02:04:04,569 --> 02:04:05,570
No! Pull off!

1522
02:04:05,987 --> 02:04:07,029
What?

1523
02:04:07,280 --> 02:04:08,698
The cannon is charged!
It's a suicide run!

1524
02:04:08,781 --> 02:04:10,116
All craft, pull away!

1525
02:04:10,283 --> 02:04:12,326
- No! I'm almost there!
- Retreat, Finn!

1526
02:04:12,535 --> 02:04:13,786
That's an order!

1527
02:04:22,753 --> 02:04:24,922
Finn? It's too late!
Don't do this!

1528
02:04:25,173 --> 02:04:27,049
No! I won't let them win!

1529
02:04:28,885 --> 02:04:31,095
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

1530
02:04:31,262 --> 02:04:32,638
We have to retreat!

1531
02:04:44,734 --> 02:04:47,153
The cannon is warming up now.

1532
02:04:47,320 --> 02:04:48,571
Copy that. We see it.

1533
02:04:48,696 --> 02:04:50,448
Preparing to fire.

1534
02:05:32,240 --> 02:05:34,075
Move! Go, go! Quick!

1535
02:05:34,242 --> 02:05:35,952
Let's go, let's go!

1536
02:05:42,333 --> 02:05:43,334
Rose?

1537
02:05:49,173 --> 02:05:50,299
Rose?

1538
02:05:50,675 --> 02:05:51,968
Rose?

1539
02:05:53,010 --> 02:05:54,110
Why would you do that?

1540
02:05:54,929 --> 02:05:56,764
I was almost there.

1541
02:05:57,598 --> 02:05:59,058
Why would you stop me?

1542
02:05:59,851 --> 02:06:01,978
I saved you...

1543
02:06:03,187 --> 02:06:04,188
dummy.

1544
02:06:05,147 --> 02:06:06,816
That's how we're gonna win.

1545
02:06:07,066 --> 02:06:09,360
Not fighting what we hate...

1546
02:06:09,819 --> 02:06:12,154
saving what we love.

1547
02:06:31,632 --> 02:06:32,967
General Hux...

1548
02:06:33,134 --> 02:06:34,677
advance.

1549
02:06:35,219 --> 02:06:36,721
No quarter.

1550
02:06:38,139 --> 02:06:39,682
No prisoners.

1551
02:06:41,434 --> 02:06:44,687
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points...

1552
02:06:44,854 --> 02:06:46,939
but no response.

1553
02:06:47,481 --> 02:06:49,233
They've heard us...

1554
02:06:49,609 --> 02:06:51,736
but no one's coming.

1555
02:06:56,073 --> 02:06:58,242
We fought till the end.

1556
02:07:00,578 --> 02:07:01,579
But...

1557
02:07:01,704 --> 02:07:05,541
the galaxy has lost all its hope.

1558
02:07:06,876 --> 02:07:08,336
The spark...

1559
02:07:10,254 --> 02:07:11,714
is out.

1560
02:07:37,323 --> 02:07:38,908
Luke.

1561
02:07:47,333 --> 02:07:49,919
I know what you're gonna say.

1562
02:07:51,128 --> 02:07:52,922
I changed my hair.

1563
02:07:54,966 --> 02:07:56,592
It's nice that way.

1564
02:07:58,594 --> 02:08:00,137
Leia...

1565
02:08:01,347 --> 02:08:02,348
I'm sorry.

1566
02:08:02,473 --> 02:08:04,350
I know.

1567
02:08:04,517 --> 02:08:06,602
I know you are.

1568
02:08:07,520 --> 02:08:09,397
I'm just glad you're here...

1569
02:08:10,398 --> 02:08:11,899
at the end.

1570
02:08:13,359 --> 02:08:15,152
I came to face him, Leia.

1571
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:19,448
And I can't save him.

1572
02:08:19,824 --> 02:08:23,035
I held out hope for so long, but...

1573
02:08:25,872 --> 02:08:28,332
I know my son is gone.

1574
02:08:29,292 --> 02:08:31,878
No one's ever really gone.

1575
02:09:07,622 --> 02:09:09,457
Master Luke.

1576
02:09:32,563 --> 02:09:33,564
Stop!

1577
02:09:59,131 --> 02:10:02,593
I want every gun we have
to fire on that man.

1578
02:10:07,807 --> 02:10:09,225
Do it.

1579
02:10:26,033 --> 02:10:27,034
More!

1580
02:10:30,538 --> 02:10:31,539
More!

1581
02:10:45,887 --> 02:10:47,471
That's enough.

1582
02:10:49,056 --> 02:10:51,184
That's enough!

1583
02:10:57,106 --> 02:10:58,691
Do you think you got him?

1584
02:11:00,067 --> 02:11:01,903
Now, if we're ready to get moving...

1585
02:11:02,153 --> 02:11:04,238
we can finish this.

1586
02:11:04,405 --> 02:11:05,531
Sir?

1587
02:11:32,016 --> 02:11:33,309
Bring me down to him.

1588
02:11:33,684 --> 02:11:36,562
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

1589
02:11:36,729 --> 02:11:37,730
Supreme Leader...

1590
02:11:38,064 --> 02:11:39,714
don't get distracted, our goal...

1591
02:11:42,068 --> 02:11:43,277
Right away, sir.

1592
02:11:44,403 --> 02:11:45,947
Med pack!

1593
02:11:46,113 --> 02:11:48,157
I need a med pack!

1594
02:11:48,366 --> 02:11:50,409
She's hurt pretty bad.

1595
02:12:09,178 --> 02:12:10,471
It's Kylo Ren.

1596
02:12:10,638 --> 02:12:11,848
Luke's facing him alone.

1597
02:12:12,014 --> 02:12:13,475
Well, we should help him.
Let's go.

1598
02:12:13,558 --> 02:12:15,184
No, wait. Wait.

1599
02:12:29,282 --> 02:12:31,492
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

1600
02:12:32,577 --> 02:12:34,453
To save my soul?

1601
02:12:36,205 --> 02:12:37,790
No.

1602
02:12:56,684 --> 02:12:58,936
He's doing this for a reason.

1603
02:13:00,771 --> 02:13:02,523
He's stalling so we can escape.

1604
02:13:02,690 --> 02:13:03,691
Escape?

1605
02:13:03,774 --> 02:13:04,776
He's one man against an army.

1606
02:13:04,859 --> 02:13:06,528
We have to help him, we have to fight.

1607
02:13:06,611 --> 02:13:08,279
No, no.
We are the spark that'll light

1608
02:13:08,362 --> 02:13:10,462
the fire that'll burn
the First Order down.

1609
02:13:11,532 --> 02:13:14,619
Skywalker's doing this so we can survive.

1610
02:13:14,869 --> 02:13:16,329
There's gotta be a way out of this mine.

1611
02:13:16,412 --> 02:13:17,580
Hell, how did he get in here?

1612
02:13:17,663 --> 02:13:18,873
Sir, it is possible

1613
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,709
that a natural unmapped opening exists.

1614
02:13:21,876 --> 02:13:24,837
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels...

1615
02:13:25,004 --> 02:13:29,342
that the odds of finding
an exit are 15,428...

1616
02:13:29,509 --> 02:13:31,052
Shut up!

1617
02:13:32,345 --> 02:13:33,971
- To one.
- Listen.

1618
02:13:36,724 --> 02:13:38,893
My audio sensors no longer detect the...

1619
02:13:38,976 --> 02:13:39,977
Exactly.

1620
02:13:46,192 --> 02:13:48,819
Where'd the crystal critters go?

1621
02:13:54,492 --> 02:13:55,493
Follow me.

1622
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:01,999
What are you looking at me for?

1623
02:14:02,250 --> 02:14:03,668
Follow him.

1624
02:14:15,304 --> 02:14:16,723
If the beacon's right beneath us,

1625
02:14:16,806 --> 02:14:17,849
they've got to be somewhere.

1626
02:14:17,932 --> 02:14:19,382
Keep scanning for life forms.

1627
02:14:29,318 --> 02:14:30,778
This way.

1628
02:14:35,157 --> 02:14:36,993
I see them! Chewie, there!

1629
02:14:50,590 --> 02:14:51,591
No.

1630
02:14:51,716 --> 02:14:53,551
No, no, no.

1631
02:14:56,721 --> 02:14:57,889
No!

1632
02:15:10,193 --> 02:15:11,986
Lifting rocks.

1633
02:15:52,109 --> 02:15:54,612
I failed you, Ben.

1634
02:15:55,446 --> 02:15:56,447
I'm sorry.

1635
02:15:56,572 --> 02:15:57,782
I'm sure you are!

1636
02:15:58,991 --> 02:16:01,035
The Resistance is dead.

1637
02:16:01,202 --> 02:16:02,787
The war is over.

1638
02:16:03,037 --> 02:16:04,956
And when I kill you...

1639
02:16:05,122 --> 02:16:07,583
I will have killed the last Jedi.

1640
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:08,793
Amazing.

1641
02:16:09,418 --> 02:16:12,046
Every word of what you just said...

1642
02:16:12,213 --> 02:16:13,214
was wrong.

1643
02:16:15,550 --> 02:16:18,636
The Rebellion is reborn today.

1644
02:16:20,847 --> 02:16:22,849
The war...

1645
02:16:23,099 --> 02:16:24,684
is just beginning.

1646
02:16:25,977 --> 02:16:29,605
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1647
02:17:09,562 --> 02:17:11,606
I'll destroy her...

1648
02:17:11,772 --> 02:17:13,816
and you...

1649
02:17:13,983 --> 02:17:15,442
and all of it.

1650
02:17:19,447 --> 02:17:20,448
No.

1651
02:17:21,574 --> 02:17:24,826
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

1652
02:17:27,455 --> 02:17:29,498
Just like your father.

1653
02:18:19,130 --> 02:18:20,132
No.

1654
02:18:24,303 --> 02:18:26,347
See you around, kid.

1655
02:18:40,111 --> 02:18:41,404
No!

1656
02:21:20,062 --> 02:21:21,063
C'ai!

1657
02:21:21,147 --> 02:21:22,190
Such a friend.

1658
02:21:23,357 --> 02:21:24,358
Chewie!

1659
02:21:26,485 --> 02:21:28,112
It looks good.

1660
02:21:28,613 --> 02:21:29,739
That was crazy, man.

1661
02:21:31,199 --> 02:21:32,617
- Hi.
- Hi.

1662
02:21:33,284 --> 02:21:34,327
I'm Poe.

1663
02:21:35,244 --> 02:21:36,245
Rey.

1664
02:21:36,537 --> 02:21:37,538
I know.

1665
02:21:49,967 --> 02:21:51,928
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

1666
02:21:52,011 --> 02:21:53,311
Quite definitely possible.

1667
02:22:03,523 --> 02:22:05,024
Luke is gone.

1668
02:22:05,983 --> 02:22:07,276
I felt it.

1669
02:22:07,902 --> 02:22:10,488
But it wasn't sadness
or pain. It was...

1670
02:22:10,988 --> 02:22:13,449
peace and purpose.

1671
02:22:14,283 --> 02:22:15,618
I felt it, too.

1672
02:22:18,287 --> 02:22:21,332
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

1673
02:22:25,711 --> 02:22:28,506
We have everything we need.

1674
02:22:48,109 --> 02:22:49,819
Luke Skywalker...

1675
02:22:50,194 --> 02:22:51,863
Jedi Master.
